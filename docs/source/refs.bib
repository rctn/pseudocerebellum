	abstract = {The cerebellum, a crucial center for motor coordination, is composed of a cortex and several nuclei. The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition onto granule cells.
          , 
            The cerebellum is a region in the brain that plays a central role in controlling posture and movement. The cerebellum is composed of a cortex and several nuclei. The nuclei are thought to ‘compute’ the signals that are sent from the cerebellum to other parts of the brain to control posture and movement. They do this under the supervision of the cortex. The main interaction between the cortex and the nuclei involves cortical neurons called Purkinje cells inhibiting the activity of the nuclei.
            Ankri, Husson et al. have now used various genetic techniques and mutant mice to identify a new population of neurons in the nuclei of the cerebellum and to express fluorescent markers into these cells. This approach reveals that the axons of these neurons ‘climb’ from the nuclei to the cortex to form a new circuit called the inhibitory nucleo-cortical (iNC) pathway. Moreover, activating the iNC axons with light reveals that they selectively target and silence a population of neurons called the Golgi cells, which control the transmission of information in the cerebellar cortex.
            Ankri, Husson et al. go on to show that the Golgi cells silenced by the iNC pathway differ from other Golgi cells in a number of ways: in particular, these Golgi cells use a chemical called GABA to communicate with neurons. The next challenge is to explore how the iNC pathway fine-tunes how sensory inputs are processed in the cerebellum, and to better understand its role in the execution of complex movements, including in people with conditions that affect motor function, such as ataxias.},

	abstract = {The functional impact of single interneurons on neuronal output in vivo and how interneurons are recruited by physiological activity patterns remain poorly understood. In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons and their targets, Purkinje cells, receive excitatory inputs from granule cells and climbing ﬁbers. Using dual patch-clamp recordings from interneurons and Purkinje cells in vivo, we probe the spatiotemporal interactions between these circuit elements. We show that single interneuron spikes can potently inhibit Purkinje cell output, depending on interneuron location. Climbing ﬁber input activates many interneurons via glutamate spillover but results in inhibition of those interneurons that inhibit the same Purkinje cell receiving the climbing ﬁber input, forming a disinhibitory motif. These interneuron circuits are engaged during sensory processing, creating diverse pathway-speciﬁc response functions. These ﬁndings demonstrate how the powerful effect of single interneurons on Purkinje cell output can be sculpted by various interneuron circuit motifs to diversify cerebellar computations.},

	abstract = {The cerebellar granular layer has been suggested to perform a complex spatiotemporal reconﬁguration of incoming mossy ﬁber signals. Central to this role is the inhibitory action exerted by Golgi cells over granule cells: Golgi cells inhibit granule cells through both feedforward and feedback inhibitory loops and generate a broad lateral inhibition that extends beyond the afferent synaptic ﬁeld. This characteristic connectivity has recently been investigated in great detail and been correlated with speciﬁc functional properties of these neurons. These include theta-frequency pacemaking, network entrainment into coherent oscillations and phase resetting. Important advances have also been made in terms of determining the membrane and synaptic properties of the neuron, and clarifying the mechanisms of activation by input bursts. Moreover, voltage sensitive dye imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, combined with mathematical simulations based on realistic computational models, have improved our understanding of the impact of Golgi cell activity on granular layer circuit computations. These investigations have highlighted the critical role of Golgi cells in: generating dense clusters of granule cell activity organized in center-surround structures, implementing combinatorial operations on multiple mossy ﬁber inputs, regulating transmission gain, and cut-off frequency, controlling spike timing and burst transmission, and determining the sign, intensity and duration of long-term synaptic plasticity at the mossy ﬁber-granule cell relay. This review considers recent advances in the ﬁeld, highlighting the functional implications of Golgi cells for granular layer network computation and indicating new challenges for cerebellar research.},

	abstract = {The cerebellar microcircuit has been the work bench for theoretical and computational modeling since the beginning of neuroscientiﬁc research. The regular neural architecture of the cerebellum inspired different solutions to the long-standing issue of how its circuitry could control motor learning and coordination. Originally, the cerebellar network was modeled using a statistical-topological approach that was later extended by considering the geometrical organization of local microcircuits. However, with the advancement in anatomical and physiological investigations, new discoveries have revealed an unexpected richness of connections, neuronal dynamics and plasticity, calling for a change in modeling strategies, so as to include the multitude of elementary aspects of the network into an integrated and easily updatable computational framework. Recently, biophysically accurate “realistic” models using a bottom-up strategy accounted for both detailed connectivity and neuronal nonlinear membrane dynamics. In this perspective review, we will consider the state of the art and discuss how these initial efforts could be further improved. Moreover, we will consider how embodied neurorobotic models including spiking cerebellar networks could help explaining the role and interplay of distributed forms of plasticity. We envisage that realistic modeling, combined with closedloop simulations, will help to capture the essence of cerebellar computations and could eventually be applied to neurological diseases and neurorobotic control systems.},

We investigated the mechanisms underpinning cerebellar oscillations. We found that Golgi interneurons, which gate information transfer in the cerebellar cortex input layer, are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. When depolarized in vitro, these neurons displayed low-frequency oscillatory synchronization, imposing rhythmic inhibition onto granule cells. Combining experiments and modeling, we show that electrical transmission of the spike afterhyperpolarization is the essential component for oscillatory population synchronization. Rhythmic ﬁring arises in spite of strong heterogeneities, is frequency tuned by the mean excitatory input to Golgi cells, and displays pronounced resonance when the modeled network is driven by oscillating inputs. In vivo, unitary Golgi cell activity was found to synchronize with low-frequency LFP oscillations occurring during quiet waking. These results suggest a major role for Golgi cells in coordinating cerebellar sensorimotor integration during oscillatory interactions.},

   abstract = {This book has had a three-fold origin, corresponding to the discoveries made by the three authors and their collaborators during the last few years - mostly since 1962. A most fruitful symposium on the cerebellum was held in Tokyo at the time of the International Physiological Congress in September 1965, and there was then formulated the project of writing this book so as to organize all this new knowledge and make it readily available, and to give opportunity for the con ceptual developments that may be seen in Chapters XI, XII and XV in particular. The present account of the physiological properties of the cerebellar cortex is based to a large extent on systematic investigations that were concerned with discovering the mode of operation of the constituent neuronal elements of the cerebellar cortex. This work was carried out in the Physiology Department of the Australian National University from 1963 to 1966 in collaboration with several visiting scientists - initially Drs. ANDERSEN, OscARssaN and VooRHOEVE and later Drs. LuNAs, SAsAKI and STRATA - to all of whom grateful thanks are extended for a great many of the figures, and even more significantly for the original and critical contributions that they made to so many aspects of this exploration into the mode of operation of the neural machinery of the cerebellar cortex.

Anatomical and optogenetic studies indicate that this non-canonical feedback is region speciﬁc: it is most prominent in lobules that regulate eye movement and process vestibular information. Collaterals provide fast, slow, and tonic inhibition to granule cells, and thus allow Purkinje cells to regulate granule cell excitability on multiple timescales. We propose that this feedback mechanism could regulate excitability of the input layer, contribute to sparse coding, and mediate temporal integration.},

It was previously thought that Golgi cells, interneurons that are the sole source of inhibition onto granule cells, were exclusively coupled via gap junctions. Moreover, Golgi cells were believed to receive GABAergic inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). Here we challenge these views by optogenetically activating the cerebellar circuitry to determine the timing and pharmacology of inhibition onto Golgi cells and by performing paired recordings to directly assess synaptic connectivity. In contrast to current thought, we ﬁnd that Golgi cells, not MLIs, make inhibitory GABAergic synapses onto other Golgi cells. As a result, MLI feedback does not regulate the Golgi cell network, and Golgi cells are inhibited approximately 2 ms before Purkinje cells, following a mossy ﬁber input. Hence, Golgi cells and Purkinje cells receive unique sources of inhibition and can differentially process shared granule cell inputs.},

It was found that, of the total volume (110-200 gm 3) of the glomeruli studied, 53\% was occupied by granule cell dendrites, 34\% by mossy terminal and 13 \% by Golgi axons. None of the four analysed glomeruli contained Golgi cell dendrites. The mossy terminals that were studied received, on the average, 53 granule cell dendrites. All of the dendrites originated from different granule cells and all made synaptic contacts with mossy terminal. However only about 60\% of granule cell dendrites made synapses with Golgi axons. The surface of the mossy terminals occupied by synaptic junctions, was found to be 5A-5.5\%. Each granule cell dendrite emitted 3-5 terminal protrusions ("dendritic digits"). Each digit receives one or more synaptic contact from either the mossy terminal (67\% of all digits), or from Golgi axon varicosities (25\%). Only about 8\% of all digits were contacted synaptically by both types of axonal terminals. All of the dendritic digits that were observed made synaptic connections. Each digit was, on the average, connected by symmetric attachment plaques to 4 neighbouring digits. Three-dimensional reconstructions of mossy terminal and some of contacting granule cell dendrites demonstrated that the dendrites curved around the central mossy terminal and were much longer than expected from earlier Golgiimpregnation studies. In addition to mossy terminals and Golgi axons, an axon terminal of small calibre that contained large, empty, spheroid vesicles were occasionally observed. These terminals, which are most likely the axonal varicosities of ascending parallel fibers, made synaptic contacts exclusively with granule cell dendrites at the periphery of the glomeruli.},

The cell density (i.e. the number of cells per unit volume) decreases from mammals with a low brain weight to those with a higher brain weight. This decrease in the number of cells is found to be proportional for all three layers of the cerebellar cortex. In addition, the ratio of Purkinje cells to granule cells was determined. In contrast to the decrease of all cell types with increasing brain weight, this ratio varies remarkably among the mammals and is not correlated with brain weight. In man, this ratio is 1:2991, while it is lower in all other mammals investigated. These differences in the ratio of Purkinje cells to granule cells and the decrease in cell density with increasing brain weight are discussed in relation to brain evolution.

	abstract = {Deﬁning the rules governing synaptic connectivity is key to formulating theories of neural circuit function. Interneurons can be connected by both electrical and chemical synapses, but the organization and interaction of these two complementary microcircuits is unknown. By recording from multiple molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellar cortex, we reveal speciﬁc, nonrandom connectivity patterns in both GABAergic chemical and electrical interneuron networks. Both networks contain clustered motifs and show speciﬁc overlap between them. Chemical connections exhibit a preference for transitive patterns, such as feedforward triplet motifs. This structured connectivity is supported by a characteristic spatial organization: transitivity of chemical connectivity is directed vertically in the sagittal plane, and electrical synapses appear strictly conﬁned to the sagittal plane. The speciﬁc, highly structured connectivity rules suggest that these motifs are essential for the function of the cerebellar network.},

Although PCs are well characterized on many levels, surprisingly little is known about their axon collaterals and their target neurons within the cerebellar cortex. It has been proposed that PC collaterals transiently control circuit assembly in early development, but it is thought that PC-to-PC connections are subsequently pruned. Here, we ﬁnd that all PCs have collaterals in young, juvenile, and adult mice. Collaterals are restricted to the parasagittal plane, and most synapses are located in close proximity to PCs. Using optogenetics and electrophysiology, we ﬁnd that in juveniles and adults, PCs make synapses onto other PCs, molecular layer interneurons, and Lugaro cells, but not onto Golgi cells. These ﬁndings establish that PC output can feed back and regulate numerous circuit elements within the cerebellar cortex and is well suited to contribute to processing in parasagittal zones.},
