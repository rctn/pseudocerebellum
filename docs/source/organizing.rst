ORGANIZING THE WEBSITE
**********************

We are new to making a website like this.  For collecting, organizing
and sharing information over the Internet, we have used Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy https://plato.stanford.edu/ as a model,
although our effort is small in comparison, and more focused.  The
data for the "Van Essen Diagram" of the hierarchy of visual areas
(Fig. 4 of Felleman & Van Essen, 1991 :cite:`FellemanDJ+VanEssenDC-1991`) is another example we have
followed, although they emphasize connections between brain areas
while we, as circuit designers, are much more concerned with actual
numbers.  A more recent example, specific to the cerebellum, comes
from a collaboration within Europe's Human Brain Project (Table 1 of
D'Angelo et al., 2016 :cite:`DAngeloE+11-2016`).

We hope to make the website into a useful source of information about
the cerebellum that is easy to navigate and to contribute to.  It is
focused narrowly on the cerebellum as an associative memory.  When you
have information that you see missing or in need of updating, please
pass it on to us for inclusion in the website--email it to

  pseudocerebellum@berkeley.edu

We plan to make submitting to the website more automatic as traffic on
the website warrants.
Your ideas for making the website more effective are welcome.

The pseudocerebellum project is housed at UC Berkeley's Redwood Center
for Theoretical Neuroscience and is funded from grants from the Air Force
Office of Scientific Research (Engineering and Information
Science/Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience) and DARPA Defense
Science Office (Artificial Intelligence Exploration/Virtual
Intelligence Processing).
