   abstract = {Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the ``open metaData Markup Language'' (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in odML-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the odML format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

   abstract = {To date, non-reproducibility of neurophysiological research is a matter of intense discussion in the scientific community. A crucial component to enhance reproducibility is to comprehensively collect and store metadata, that is, all information about the experiment, the data, and the applied preprocessing steps on the data, such that they can be accessed and shared in a consistent and simple manner. However, the complexity of experiments, the highly specialized analysis workflows and a lack of knowledge on how to make use of supporting software tools often overburden researchers to perform such a detailed documentation. For this reason, the collected metadata are often incomplete, incomprehensible for outsiders or ambiguous. Based on our research experience in dealing with diverse datasets, we here provide conceptual and technical guidance to overcome the challenges associated with the collection, organization, and storage of metadata in a neurophysiology laboratory. Through the concrete example of managing the metadata of a complex experiment that yields multi-channel recordings from monkeys performing a behavioral motor task, we practically demonstrate the implementation of these approaches and solutions with the intention that they may be generalized to other projects. Moreover, we detail five use cases that demonstrate the resulting benefits of constructing a well-organized metadata collection when processing or analyzing the recorded data, in particular when these are shared between laboratories in a modern scientific collaboration. Finally, we suggest an adaptable workflow to accumulate, structure and store metadata from different sources using, by way of example, the odML metadata framework.},

The cerebellum is postulated to be functionally and structurally equivalent to a modification of the classical Perceptron pattern-classification device. It is suggested that the mossy fiber-f granule cell-f Golgi cell input network performs an expansion recoding that enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells are all postulated to be specifically variable in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued that this variability is the mechanism of pattern storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the learning process to be stable, pattern storage must be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic weights rather than by strengthening them.},

For the cerebellar cortex, this type of knowledge is comparatively advanced and can at least in some aspects be regarded as sufficient for predicting the behavioral modulations of a single neuron. The aim of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge about cerebellar neuronal codes and to pinpoint the remaining weak spots in our knowledge that prevent us from making predictions of the cerebellar neuronal code. It is concluded that, whereas the cerebellar neuronal circuitry in itself is highly characterized, there is an urgent need for characterizing the types and ranges of encoding in the mossy fiber systems. It is also concluded that cerebellar neuronal representations can be expected to be widely distributed, and the firing of individual cerebellar neurons is likely to represent only the bits and pieces of such distributed representations.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum, due to its regular internal connectivity and the limited number of neuronal types, has inspired a series of modeling efforts. These vary in complexity and aim, ranging from single-neuron to network and system control models. Initially, theoretical models provided remarkable predictions on how the cerebellum might operate in the context of the sensorimotor control system, though at the expense of oversimplifications in neuron and network representation. Recently, two main advances have occurred, promoted by the availability of new physiological knowledge and by informatics technology. First, detailed biophysically grounded models of neurons and synapses have been developed and are now reaching a high level of sophistication, allowing a careful analysis of single-neuron computation. Major advances have been made with granule cell, Golgi cell, unipolar brush cell, Purkinje cell, deep cerebellar nucleus, and inferior olivary cell models. Moreover, dynamic synaptic models and networks of local microcircuits have been constructed. Second, it has been possible to transform these models into real-time versions, which have subsequently been applied to robotic simulations. Notably, real-time spiking networks of the cerebellum have been endowed with plasticity rules and embedded into robotic control systems. Thus, it is now becoming possible to translate the biophysical properties of neurons and synapses into network functions and to observe how these are exploited in the context of simulated behaviors. These observations are providing new insights into how single-neuron and connectivity properties are exploited by the cerebellar network operating in a closed loop.},

Under the pretense of a sport application, after a quick review of the 4- to 25-Hz GCL phenomena, here we develop a hypothesis on how information flow through the cerebellar cortex could be modulated by local GCL networks and serve to establish a potential role for expectancy-based sensory comparisons.

The anatomy of the cerebellum is highly conserved across mammals and comparison of functional data suggests that similar principles of organization also hold true for somatotopy. In particular, there is a dual representation of the limbs in the cerebellar cortex in rat, ferret, cat, monkey, and human. In animals, a key organizing principle of the cerebellum is its division into a series of longitudinally oriented olivocorticonuclear modules that are narrow in the mediolateral axis but extend across multiple cerebellar lobules in the rostrocaudal plane. This contrasts with existing understanding of the human cerebellum that suggests that functional compartmentation is organized mainly at the level of different lobes and lobules. However, advances in spatial resolution of imaging techniques mean we are now able to start to examine whether a longitudinal modular organization is also present within the human cerebellum. This has implications for the diagnosis and future treatment of clinical disorders that involve the cerebellum, since it is possible that variations in symptomatology may relate to this finer grain localization.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is thought to play a critical role in procedural learning, but the relationship between this function and the underlying cellular and synaptic mechanisms remains largely speculative. At present, at least nine forms of long-term synaptic and nonsynaptic plasticity (some of which are bidirectional) have been reported in the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. These include long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse, at the synapses formed by parallel fibers, climbing fibers, and molecular layer interneurons on Purkinje cells, and at the synapses formed by mossy fibers and Purkinje cells on deep cerebellar nuclear cells, as well as LTP of intrinsic excitability in granule cells, Purkinje cells, and deep cerebellar nuclear cells. It is suggested that the complex properties of cerebellar learning would emerge from the distribution of plasticity in the network and from its dynamic remodeling during the different phases of learning. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors may hold the key to explain how the different forms of plasticity cooperate to select specific transmission channels and to regulate the signal-to-noise ratio through the cerebellar cortex. These factors include regulation of neuronal excitation by local inhibitory networks, engagement of specific molecular mechanisms by spike bursts and theta-frequency oscillations, and gating by external neuromodulators. Therefore, a new and more complex view of cerebellar plasticity is emerging with respect to that predicted by the original "Motor Learning Theory," opening issues that will require experimental and computational testing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..},

   abstract = {In order to ameliorate the consequences of ego motion for vision, human and nonhuman observers generate reflexive, compensatory eye movements based on visual as well as vestibular information, helping to stabilize the images of visual scenes on the retina despite ego motion. And in order to fully exploit the advantages of foveal vision, they make saccades to shift the image of an object onto the fovea and smooth pursuit eye movements to stabilize it there despite continuing object movement relative to the observer. With the exception of slow visually driven eye movements, which can be understood as manifestations of relatively straightforward feedback systems, most eye movements require a direct conversion of sensory input into appropriate motor responses in the absence of immediate sensory feedback. Hence, in order to generate appropriate oculomotor responses, the parameters linking input and output must be chosen suitably. Moreover, as the parameters may change from one manifestation of a movement to the next, for instance because of oculomotor fatigue, the choices should also be quickly modifiable. This chapter will present evidence showing that this fast parametric optimization, understood as a functionally distinct example of motor learning, is an accomplishment of specific parts of the cerebellum devoted to the control of eye movements. It will also discuss recent electrophysiological results suggesting how this specific form of motor learning may emerge from information processing in cerebellar circuits. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is a central brain structure deeply integrated into major loops with the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. The cerebellum shows a complex regional organization consisting of modules with sagittal orientation. The cerebellum takes part in motor control and its lesions cause a movement incoordination syndrome called ataxia. Recent observations also imply involvement of the cerebellum in cognition and executive control, with an impact on pathologies like dyslexia and autism. The cerebellum operates as a forward controller learning to predict the precise timing of correlated events. The physiologic mechanisms of cerebellar functioning are still the object of intense research. The signals entering the cerebellum through the mossy fibers are processed in the granular layer and transmitted to Purkinje cells, while a collateral pathway activates the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Purkinje cells in turn inhibit DCN, so that the cerebellar cortex operates as a side loop controlling the DCN. Learning is now known to occur through synaptic plasticity at multiple synapses in the granular layer, molecular layer, and DCN, extending the original concept of the Motor Learning Theory that predicted a single form of plasticity at the synapse between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells under the supervision of climbing fibers deriving from the inferior olive. Coordination derives from the precise regulation of timing and gain in the different cerebellar modules. The investigation of cerebellar dynamics using advanced physiologic recordings and computational models is now providing new clues on how the cerebellar network performs its internal computations.},

   abstract = {Many cerebellar models use a form of synaptic plasticity that implements decorrelation learning. Parallel fibers carrying signals positively correlated with climbing-fiber input have their synapses weakened (long-term depression), whereas those carrying signals negatively correlated with climbing input have their synapses strengthened (long-term potentiation). Learning therefore ceases when all parallel-fiber signals have been decorrelated from climbing-fiber input. This is a computationally powerful rule for supervised learning and can be cast in a spike-timing dependent plasticity form for comparison with experimental evidence. Decorrelation learning is particularly well suited to sensory prediction, for example, in the reafference problem where external sensory signals are interfered with by reafferent signals from the organism's own movements, and the required circuit appears similar to the one found to mediate classical eye blink conditioning. However, for certain stimuli, avoidance is a much better option than simple prediction, and decorrelation learning can also be used to acquire appropriate avoidance movements. One example of a stimulus to be avoided is retinal slip that degrades visual processing, and decorrelation learning appears to play a role in the vestibulo-ocular reflex that stabilizes gaze in the face of unpredicted head movements. Decorrelation learning is thus suitable for both sensory prediction and motor control. It may also be well suited for generic spatial and temporal coordination, because of its ability to remove the unwanted side effects of movement. Finally, because it can be used with any kind of time-varying signal, the cerebellum could play a role in cognitive processing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Cellular and molecular processes underlying LTD occur postsynaptically. In the 1960s, LTD was conceived as a theoretical possibility and in the 1980s, substantiated experimentally. Through further investigations using various pharmacological or genetic manipulations of LTD, a concept was formed that LTD plays a major role in learning capability of the cerebellum (referred to as "Marr-Albus-Ito hypothesis"). In this chapter, following a historical overview, recent intensive investigations of LTD are reviewed. Complex signal transduction and receptor recycling processes underlying LTD are analyzed, and roles of LTD in reflexes and voluntary movements are defined. The significance of LTD is considered from viewpoints of neural network modeling. Finally, the controversy arising from the recent finding in a few studies that whereas LTD is blocked pharmacologically or genetically, motor learning in awake behaving animals remains seemingly unchanged is examined.

The technique takes into account the three-dimensional (3D) direction of diffusion of water in space, the brownian movements of water being constrained by the brain microstructure. The main direction of diffusion in the brain is extracted to obtain the principal direction of axonal projection within a given voxel. Overall, the diffusion tensor is a mathematic analysis of the magnitude/directionality (anisotropy) of the movement of water molecules in 3D space. Tracts running in the white matter are subsequently reconstructed graphically with fiber tractography. Tractography can be applied to myelinated and unmyelinated fibers or axonopathy. Decreased fractional anisotropy in white-matter tracts occurs in cases of injury with disorganized or disrupted myelin sheaths. Furthermore, high angular resolution methods enable detection of fiber crossings or convergence. DTI is a modern tool which complements conventional magnetic resonance techniques and is particularly relevant to assess the organization of cerebellar tracts. Indeed, both the afferent and efferent pathways of the cerebellar circuitry passing through the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles can be visualized in vivo, including in children. The microanatomy of the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei is also emerging as a future assessment. Applications in the field of cerebellar disorders are multiple, ranging from developmental disorders to adult-onset cerebellar ataxias.},

This chapter reviews results on how movement-related information is encoded in the activity of the deep cerebellar nuclei to understand how the cerebellum might influence the motor cortex. The chapter mainly describes and contrasts the activity of the interpositus and dentate in behavioral tasks that involve voluntary forelimb movements, as the cerebellar projection to the motor cortex arises mainly from these nuclei. The results are discussed with regard to whether they support the traditional hierarchical view of motor systems and with regard to what they tell us about cerebellar input to the motor cortex. The chapter concludes by discussing findings about the physiological heterogeneity of Purkinje cells and the cerebellar nuclear cells and how this may underlie the diverse patterns of movement-related activity shown by nuclear cells.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is essential for some forms of motor learning. Two examples that provide useful experimental models are modification of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response (NMR) in the rabbit. There has been considerable analysis of these behavioral models and of conditioning of the eyelid blink reflex, which is similar in several respects to NMR conditioning but with some key differences in its control circuitry. The evidence is consistent with the suggestion that storage of these motor memories is to be found within the cerebellum and its associated brainstem circuitry. The cerebellum presents many advantages as a model system to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning behavioral learning. And yet, localizing the essential synaptic changes has proven to be difficult. A major problem has been to establish to what extent these neural changes are distributed through the cerebellar cortex, cerebellar nuclei, and associated brainstem nuclei. Inspired by recent theoretical work, here we review evidence that the distribution of plasticity across cortical and cerebellar nuclear (or brainstem vestibular system) levels for different learning tasks may be different and distinct. Our primary focus is on classical conditioning of the NMR and eyelid blink, and we offer comparisons with mechanisms for modifications of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. We describe a view of cerebellar learning that satisfies theoretical and empirical analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {During the past decades neuroanatomic, neuroimaging, and clinical studies have substantially changed the long-standing view of the role of the cerebellum as a sole coordinator of sensorimotor function. Currently, the cerebellum is considered to be crucially implicated in a variety of cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral processes as well. In this chapter we aim to summarize a number of critical insights from different research areas (neuroanatomy, functional neuroimaging, clinical practice) that provide evidence for a role of the cerebellum in motor speech and nonmotor language processing in both adults and children. Neuroanatomic studies have provided a robust basis for the development of new insights in the modulatory role of the cerebellum in neurocognition, including nonmotor language processing by means of identifying a dense network of crossed reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and the supratentorial association areas. A topologic distinction has been established between the “motor” cerebellum, projecting to the cortical motor areas, and the “cognitive/affective” cerebellum, connected with the cortical and limbic association areas. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated cerebellar involvement in several different language tasks, even after controlling for motor aspects. In addition, several clinical studies have identified a variety of nonmotor linguistic deficits after cerebellar disease in both children and adults, implying a prominent role for the cerebellum in linguistic processes. Functional neuroimaging has confirmed the functional impact of cerebellar lesions on remote, structurally intact cortical regions via crossed cerebellocerebral diaschisis. Overall, evidence from neuroanatomic, neuroimaging, and clinical studies shows a (strongly lateralized) involvement of the cerebellum in a broad spectrum of nonmotor language functions through a dense network of crossed and reciprocal cerebellocerebral connections. It is argued that the cerebellum is involved in language in a similar manner as it is involved in motor functions: through monitoring/coordinating cortical functions via timing and sequencing mechanisms.},

The results suggest that trait repetition recruits activity in areas belonging to the mentalizing and executive control networks in the cerebrum, and the executive control areas in the cerebellum. Cerebral activation was observed in the executive control network including the posterior medial frontal cortex (pmFC), the bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC), in the mentalizing network including the bilateral middle temporal cortex (MTC) extending to the right superior temporal cortex (STC), as well as in the visual network including the left cuneus (Cun) and the left inferior occipital cortex. Moreover, cerebellar activation was found bilaterally in lobules VI and VII belonging to the executive control network. Importantly, significant patterns of functional connectivity were found linking these cerebellar executive areas with cerebral executive areas in the medial pmFC, the left PFC and the left IPC, and mentalizing areas in the left MTC. In addition, connectivity was found between the cerebral areas in the left hemisphere involved in the executive and mentalizing networks, as well as with their homolog areas in the right hemisphere. The discussion centers on the role of these cerebello-cerebral connections in matching internal predictions generated by the cerebellum with external information from the cerebrum, presumably involving the sequencing of behaviors.},

Gait ataxia and extremity dysmetria are clinical manifestations of diseases that interrupt the complex cerebellar circuitry between the neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the cerebellar nuclei (especially the dentate nuclei), and the inferior olivary nuclei. The cerebellum is a prominent target of several sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Friedreich ataxia. Purkinje cells display selective vulnerability to hypoxia but a surprising resistance to hypoglycemia. A classic toxin that damages the cerebellar cortex is methylmercury, but the most common injurious agent to Purkinje cells is ethanol. Many drugs cause ataxia, but doubts continue about phenytoin. Ischemic lesions of the cerebellum due to arterial thrombosis or embolism cause a spectrum of symptoms and signs, depending on the territory involved. Large hemorrhages have an unfavorable prognosis because they displace critical brainstem structures or penetrate into the fourth ventricle. Fungal infections and toxoplasmosis of the cerebellum, and cerebellar progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, have become rarer because of improved control of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Ataxia is a prominent feature of prion disease. Adult-onset Niemann–Pick type C1 disease and Kufs disease may have a predominantly ataxic clinical phenotype. The adult cerebellum is also vulnerable to several leukodystrophies. A rare but widely recognized complication of cancer is paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.},

In this view, sensory prediction errors, defined as the discrepancy between the predicted consequences of motor commands and the sensory feedback, are crucial for online movement control and motor learning. The cerebellum has been implicated in these computations. New results demonstrate that the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells signals effector kinematics and performance errors. Each motor parameter is encoded by a pair of signals, one leading and one lagging the actual movement. These dual-firing representations are consistent with the predictive and feedback signals needed to generate sensory prediction errors. Furthermore, the encoding of kinematics and performance errors in the simple spike discharge suggests the cerebellum acquires forward internal models of both effectors and task-specific parameters.},

Key examined properties of HD computing include: a versatile set of arithmetic operations on HD vectors, generality, scalability, analyzability, one-shot learning, and energy efficiency. These make it a prime candidate for efficient biosignal processing where signals are noisy and nonstationary, training data sets are not huge, individual variability is significant, and energy-efficiency constraints are tight. Purely based on native HD computing operators, we describe a combined method for multiclass learning and classification of various ExG biosignals such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG). We develop a full set of HD network templates that comprehensively encode body potentials and brain neural activity recorded from different electrodes into a single HD vector without requiring domain expert knowledge or ad hoc electrode selection process. Such encoded HD vector is processed as a single unit for fast one-shot learning, and robust classification. It can be interpreted to identify the most useful features as well. Compared to state-of-the-art counterparts, HD computing enables online, incremental, and fast learning as it demands less than a third as much training data as well as less preprocessing.},

   abstract = {During learning, performance changes often involve a transition from controlled processing in which performance is flexible and responsive to ongoing error feedback, but effortful and slow, to a state in which processing becomes swift and automatic. In this state, performance is unencumbered by the requirement to process feedback, but its insensitivity to feedback reduces its flexibility. Many properties of automatic processing are similar to those that one would expect of forward models, and many have suggested that these may be instantiated in cerebellar circuitry. Since hierarchically organized frontal lobe areas can both send and receive commands, I discuss the possibility that they can act both as controllers and controlled objects and that their behaviors can be independently modeled by forward models in cerebellar circuits. Since areas of the prefrontal cortex contribute to this hierarchically organized system and send outputs to the cerebellar cortex, I suggest that the cerebellum is likely to contribute to the automation of cognitive skills, and to the formation of habitual behavior which is resistant to error feedback. An important prerequisite to these ideas is that cerebellar circuitry should have access to higher order error feedback that signals the success or failure of cognitive processing. I have discussed the pathways through which such feedback could arrive via the inferior olive and the dopamine system. Cerebellar outputs inhibit both the inferior olive and the dopamine system. It is possible that learned representations in the cerebellum use this as a mechanism to suppress the processing of feedback in other parts of the nervous system. Thus, cerebellar processes that control automatic performance may be completed without triggering the engagement of controlled processes by prefrontal mechanisms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The ability to anticipate future events and to modify erroneous anticipatory actions is crucial for the survival of any organism. Both theoretical and empirical lines of evidence implicate the cerebellum in this ability. It is often suggested that the cerebellum acquires "expectations" or "internal models." However, except in a metaphorical sense, the cerebellum, which consists of a set of interconnected nerve cells, cannot contain "internal models" or "have expectations." In this chapter, we try to untangle these metaphors by translating them back into neurophysiological cause and effect relationships. We approach this task from within the paradigm of classical conditioning, in which a subject, through repeated presentations of a conditional stimulus, followed by an unconditional stimulus, acquires a conditioned response. Importantly, the conditioned response is timed so that it anticipates the unconditioned response. Available neurophysiological evidence suggests that Purkinje cells, in the cerebellar cortex, generate the conditioned response. In addition, Purkinje cells provide negative feedback to the inferior olive, which is a relay for the unconditional stimulus, via the nucleo-olivary pathway. Purkinje cells can therefore regulate the intensity of the signal derived from the unconditional stimulus, which, in turn, decides subsequent plasticity. Hence, as learning progresses, the olivary signal will become weaker and weaker due to increasing negative feedback from Purkinje cells. Thus, in an important sense, learning-induced changes in Purkinje cell activity constitute an "expectation" or "anticipation" of a future event (the unconditional stimulus), and, consistent with theoretical models, future learning depends on the accuracy of this expectation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

DCN neurons have the requisite biophysical characteristics to exhibit rebound firing and fire a brief but high-frequency burst of action potentials after pauses brought about by strong hyperpolarizations. Rebound firing is an attractive coding mechanism as it can provide a timed signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio to downstream motor areas. However, whether DCN rebound firing is a common signaling mechanism under physiological conditions remains to be demonstrated. We analyzed postpause firing rates of DCN neurons in awake animals in vivo under a number of behavioral conditions, including cerebellar-intensive behaviors such as balancing on a beam and walking on a treadmill. We did not find any evidence in support of a role for rebound firing in encoding information under any of these behavioral conditions.},

Four different forms of CN spike modulation by Purkinje cell input have been suggested: a simple inversion of Purkinje cell spike rates by the CN, rebound responses after cessation of inhibitory Purkinje cell input, time-locking of CN spikes to synchronized Purkinje cell spikes, and the decoding of irregular Purkinje cell input based on short-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses.

Three principal cerebellar networks are identified and cerebellar disease often affects components of the networks other than just the cerebellar cortex. Contemporary developmental neuropathology of the cerebellum is best considered in the context of alterations of developmental processes: embryonic segmentation and genetic gradients along the three axes of the neural tube, individual neuronal and glial cell differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis, and myelination. Precisely timed developmental processes may be delayed or precocious rhombencephalosynapsis and pontocerebellar hypoplasia exemplify opposite gradients in the horizontal axis. Chiari II malformation may be reconsidered as a disorder of segmentation rather than simply due to mechanical forces upon normally developing hindbrain structures. Cellular nodules in the roof of the fourth ventricle are heterotopia of histologically differentiated but architecturally disoriented and disorganized neurons and glial cells; they often are less mature immunocytochemically than similar cells in adjacent normal folia. Cell rests are nodules of undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells. Both are frequent in human fetuses and neonates. Axonal projections from heterotopia to adjacent cerebellar folia or nuclei are few or absent, hence these nodules are clinically silent despite neuronal differentiation.},

A core tenet of this new understanding of cerebellar function is the existence of functional subregions within the cerebellum that differentially support motor, cognitive, and affective behaviors. This cerebellar functional topography – based on converging evidence from neuroanatomic, neuroimaging, and clinical studies – is evident in both adult and pediatric populations. The sensorimotor homunculi in the anterior lobe and lobule VIII established in early tract tracing and electrophysiologic studies are evident in both task-based and resting-state human functional imaging studies. In patients, damage to the anterior cerebellum, extending into medial lobule VI, is associated with the cerebellar motor syndrome. The cerebellar posterior lobe, including vermal and hemispheric regions of lobules VI and VII, is reciprocally interconnected with cerebral association and paralimbic cortices. Resting-state and task-based neuroimaging studies show functional activation patterns in these regions during higher-level cognitive tasks, and lesions of the posterior cerebellum lead to the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome with its characteristic intellectual and emotional impairments. The existence of cerebellar connectional and functional topography provides the critical anatomic substrate for a cerebellar role in both motor and nonmotor functions. It also establishes a framework for interpreting cerebellar activation patterns, cognitive and behavioral outcomes following cerebellar damage, and the cerebellar structural and functional differences reported in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

   abstract = {How does the brain allow us to acquire a new motor skill or to adjust an available skill to new needs? This is a central question for researchers trying to understand the neural basis of motor learning. Studies of the adjustment of eye movements to new requirements have advanced our understanding of the neuronal processes in the cerebellum that underlie the unfolding of the learned behavior. Saccades are highly skilled eye movements that quickly and accurately rotate the eye so that the image of objects of interest shifts onto the fovea. In this review, we try to provide an overview of the findings on the role of the cerebellum in helping to control and to optimize saccades. We focus on the role of the major cerebellar representation of saccades, the oculomotor vermis. We concentrate on the plastic changes that are observed in the firing of the Purkinje cells of the oculomotor vermis during the acquisition of the desired saccade response. We describe how the altered activity of these neurons may interact with the brain-stem premotor circuitry for saccades.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, motor learning has been studied as an implicit learning process, one in which movement errors are used to improve performance in a continuous, gradual manner. The cerebellum figures prominently in this literature given well-established ideas about the role of this system in error-based learning and the production of automatized skills. Recent developments have brought into focus the relevance of multiple learning mechanisms for sensorimotor learning. These include processes involving repetition, reinforcement learning, and strategy utilization. We examine these developments, considering their implications for understanding cerebellar function and how this structure interacts with other neural systems to support motor learning. Converging lines of evidence from behavioral, computational, and neuropsychological studies suggest a fundamental distinction between processes that use error information to improve action execution or action selection. While the cerebellum is clearly linked to the former, its role in the latter remains an open question. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {This chapter is concerned with ideas on the function, structure, and pathology that shaped our present knowledge of the cerebellum. One of the main themes in its early history is its localization subtentorially, leading to misattributions due to clinical observations in trauma and lesion experiments that caused collateral damage to the brainstem. Improvement of techniques led to the insight that it plays a role in movement control (Rolando) or coordination (Flourens). Purkinje initiated the histology of the cerebellar cortex in 1837. Luciani's experiments in 1891 led him to conclude that the cerebellum has a tonic facilitating effect on central structures. Cajal identified the elements of the cortex and their circuitry (1888–1891). The inhibitory nature of the interneurons and the Purkinje cells, and the excitatory connections of the mossy and climbing afferents and the granule cells were established much later by Eccles and Ito. A functional localization for the coordinating action of the cerebellum of the motor system, based on local expansion of the folial chains, was devised by Bolk in 1906. Babinski and Holmes contributed to anatomoclinical insights. Magnus and coworkers showed the cerebellum does not play an essential role in body posture. The heterogeneity of the Purkinje cells with respect to their connections and histochemistry found its expression in the zonal organization of the cerebellar cortex. The roots of modern developments, like cerebellar learning and its involvement in cognition and emotion, can be traced to the theories of Marr and Albus and the pioneering work of the Leiners and Dow.},

   abstract = {About 40 years ago, a subpopulation of small neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei were shown to project to the inferior olive, the source of the climbing fiber input to the cerebellum. This nucleo-olivary projection follows the zonal and probably also microzonal arrangement of the cerebellum so that closed loops are formed between the neurons in the olive, the cerebellar cortex, and the deep nuclei. Although it was first thought to be excitatory, it was independently shown that the cells were GABAergic and that activity in the nucleo-olivary pathway inhibits olivary activity. A number of functions have been suggested for this inhibition: (a) feedback control of learning, (b) gating of olivary input in general, and (c) feedback control of background activity in Purkinje cells. Evidence is consistent with (a) and (c). Activity in the nucleo-olivary pathway suppresses both synaptic transmission and background activity in the olive. When conditioned blink responses develop, the blink-related part of the olive is inhibited. When the nucleo-olivary pathway is interrupted, there is a corresponding increase in complex spike discharge in Purkinje cells followed by a strong suppression of simple spike firing. Stimulation of the pathway has the opposite results. It is concluded that the nucleo-olivary fibers are inhibitory and that they form a number of independent feedback loops, each one specific for a microcomplex, in a system that regulates cerebellar learning as well as spontaneous activity in the cerebello-olivocerebellar circuit. Besides these inhibitory effects, it has been argued that the nucleo-olivary pathway regulates electrotonic coupling between olivary cells.},

   abstract = {There is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that the cerebellum participates in limbic-related functions including emotion and affect. The underlying connectivity of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei with limbic-related brain areas and associative and paralimbic cortices suggests widespread cerebellar influence on behaviors including the experience and expression of emotion, sadness and grief, integrative hypothalamic visceral/sensory functions, pain perception, modulation, and intensity due to noxious stimuli, as well as other nonmotor behaviors. The key anatomical relationships are the fastigial nucleus projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), cerebellar interconnections with the septum, hippocampus and amygdala, direct cerebellar connections with hypothalamic circuits that integrate somatic-, visceral-, and limbic-related activity, and indirect connections with the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a mesolimbic dopaminergic structure that predicts activity in a reward paradigm in limbic-related structures. Additionally, the cerebellum is interconnected with cingulate cortices that play a role in motivation and emotional drive, and with associative and paralimbic regions of prefrontal, posterior parietal, superior temporal polymodal, and parahippocampal regions heavily implicated in high order processing important for the integration of cognition and emotion. These connections between cortical and subcortical areas of the limbic system with the cerebellum (vermis and fastigial nucleus in particular) are the likely anatomical underpinning of the demonstrated cerebellar influence on limbic-related behaviors in the clinical setting and in earlier behavioral and physiological studies. These cerebellar connections with cerebral limbic areas are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism which demonstrate neuropathology and aberrant neurochemistry in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. Defining the vermis and fastigial nuclei as the probable location of the limbic cerebellum has relevance for future studies of cerebrocerebellar interconnections and functional coupling, and for therapeutic strategies that attempt to enhance cerebellar modulation of limbic-related structures in order to treat neuropsychiatric disorders.},

In this review we discuss experiments designed to increase our understanding of how visual inputs to the cerebellum are arranged in relation to the zonal organization of the cerebellar cortex, and how visual inputs are utilized to assist in the regulation of a visually guided movement. On the basis of anatomical and physiological characteristics our findings indicate that the medial-most folium in crus I of the cat lateral cerebellum can be subdivided into at least three functionally distinct zones; from lateral to medial along the length of the folium these correspond to zones D1, lateral C3 and C2. Each zone displays clear differences in olivo-cortico-nuclear connectivity and in the anesthetized animal zones D1 and C2 both receive powerful visual inuts relayed via the climbing fiber system. Complementary experiments in awake behaving cats found that Purkinje cells located in the D1 and D2 zones of crus I exhibit changes in simple spike discharge time locked to target motion during a visually guided reaching task. These changes were unaffected by temporary visual denial of the target, raising the possibility that internally generated feedforward visuomotor control mechanisms are operating, in which a predictive model of the target's motion has been constructed by the CNS.},

   abstract = {By blocking electrical activity in the cerebellar cortex the Purkinje cell dendrites become a uniform territory with a high density of spines all bearing the glutamate receptor d2 subunit (GluRd2) and being mainly innervated by parallel fibers. Such a subunit, which is constitutively targeted specifically to the parallel fiber synapses, appears in the spines contacted by the climbing fibers before they disconnect from the target. A similar pattern of hyperspiny transformation and innervation occurs a few days after a subtotal lesion of the inferior olive, the source of climbing fibers. During the climbing fiber reinnervation process which follows the removal of the electrical block or by collateral sprouting of surviving inferior olive neurons, the new active climbing fibers establish synaptic contacts with proximal dendritic spines that bear GluRd2s. After, they repress these subunits and displace the parallel fibers to the distal dendritic territory. These findings suggest the following operational principle in the axonal competition for a common target. The Purkinje cells have an intrinsic phenotypic profile which is compatible with the parallel fiber innervation, this mode being operational in targets innervated by a single neuronal population, like the neuromuscular system. An additional input, the climbing fibers, in order to achieve its own territory on the proximal dendrite needs the ability to displace the competitor. Such an inhibition is activity-dependent and the activity needs to be present in order to allow the climbing fiber to maintain its territory, even when the developmental period is over.},

   abstract = {A powerful conceptual framework for the generation of fast, coordinated movements is based on the central nervous system implementing internal models. Internal models provide for representations of the input-output properties of the motor apparatus. There are two general classes of internal models. Forward models use the commands for an action and information about the present state to predict the consequences of that action. Inverse models transform a desired outcome or effector state into the necessary commands to achieve that state. It has been widely hypothesized that the cerebellum acquires and stores internal models. Initially formulated to explain the cerebellum’s role in motor control, the concept has been extended to include internal models for tool use and cognitive processes. In patients with cerebellar dysfunction, the deficits can be attributed to a failure of internal models to generate the appropriate model commands and/or to accurately estimate the consequences of motor commands. Functional imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in normal subjects provide further support for this hypothesis. Electrophysiological investigations have also examined whether neurons in the cerebellar cortex have the requisite signals compatible with either an inverse or forward internal model. In monkeys it remains uncertain whether the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells has the requisite motor command signals required to be the output of an inverse dynamics model. However, Purkinje cell firing has several of the characteristics of a forward internal model. Furthermore, the function of cerebellar-like structures in several groups of electric fishes is to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands, suggesting that the cerebellar architecture can support the computations required by a forward model.},

However, the quality of the control is challenged by several factors like biological noise and delays. It is widely believed that the CNS overcomes these challenges by calculating an estimation of the state, available before the sensors provide any information. This state prediction is the output of internal forward models. Control theory schemes have been used to summarize the existing knowledge about state estimation and to improve our understanding of human movement control. The first part of this chapter presents control theory frameworks that have been proposed based on the concepts of state prediction and state estimation. The concepts introduced by control theory models can only be validated, extended, or discarded based on experimental evidence. There is a plethora of studies suggesting that the cerebellum holds internal forward models, and is thus responsible for the calculation of the state prediction. The second part of this chapter reviews converging evidence from neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and behavioral neuroscience that illustrate the contribution of the cerebellum to state estimation. Functional imaging experiments, patient studies, and adaptation experiments suggest that cerebellar learning mechanisms are critical for accurate state estimation.},

   abstract = {The cerebral cortex occupies a prominent place in the social brain hypothesis, which posits that human brain evolution has largely been shaped by social interactions in an increasingly more complex group structure and the associated cognitive tasks at the cerebral cortical level. Social interactions are adaptive behaviors in responses to selection pressure and are also the sources of selection pressure. Complex social interactions both require and foster communication. To communicate and transmit information, individual members of the group must acquire a common language of communication, most certainly via imitation. Hurley has recently proposed a shared circuits model for imitation. This model has implicated many cerebral cortical structures, including the mirror neuron system. In this model, a basic element supporting complex behavior leading to imitation is active perception. Neuroplasticity mechanisms in the cerebellum and particularly in the neocerebellum may be the major provider of this critical function such that active perception constitutes part of the cerebellar function of procedural learning, or vice versa. In this chapter, the role of the cerebellum in the evolution of complex behaviors is examined. Data from fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal are summarized to show a phylogenetic expansion of the neocerebellum to interact with the neocortex. Within mammals, there is a progressive increase in the capacity of the cerebellum to code and process information from mouse, rat, cat, rhesus monkey, and human. The increasingly expanding interactions between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum operating with a high information coding and processing capacity may uniquely contribute to the acquisition of complex behavior including language and communication for social interaction - a major hallmark of human evolution.},

   abstract = {Cerebellar control of posture is mainly based on the connections of the cerebellum with brainstem reticular formation and vestibular system, which are the source of the medial descending system providing the control of the body, i.e., posture and balance. The story of studying the role of cerebellum in postural control started from the works of Rolando, Flourens, Magendie, and especially Luciani who pointed out the role of the cerebellum in control of postural tone and muscle force. He described the main results of cerebellar lesions: atonia, asthenia, astasia, and dysmetria. The studies were continued by Lewandowsky, Thomas, Babinski, Bekhterev, Sherrington and, in twentieth century, by Dow and Moruzzi, Ito, Diener, Dichgans, and others. Postural disturbances after cerebellar lesions are described both in animals and in patients. Particularly, MRI data were very efficient to provide correlations between lesions of a definite area of the cerebellum and disturbances of posture and locomotion. The fMRI studies of human locomotor centers revealed the activation including pacemakers for gait initiation and speed regulation in the interfastigial cerebellum and bilateral midbrain tegmentum (cerebellar and mesencephalic locomotor regions), their descending target regions in the pontine reticular formation, and the rhythm generators in the cerebellar vermis and paravermal cortex. A genetic approach is actively used for studying cerebellar control of posture. Specific genes expressed in cerebellum encoding glutamate receptors and other molecules were shown to affect postural control in mice. Plasticity in cerebellum (synaptogenesis, increasing dendritic trees) was described after complicated motor training. The role of cerebellum in learning was studied by Brindley, Marr, Albus, Thach, Ito, and others. The role of the cerebellum in the reorganization of posture and in learning new postural tasks in animals and humans has also been investigated. Though other brain systems such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex-pyramidal system are specifically involved in this process as well, the cerebellum seems to be one of the main structures providing learning of voluntary control of posture. The cerebellar mechanisms of feedback learning could be a basis of this process. In particular, the motor cortex might be involved in feedback control whereas the cerebellum might play a role in feedforward control by acquiring inverse models in new postural tasks.},

   abstract = {The cerebellar nuclei (CN) and the vestibular nucleus are the only recipients of output from the cerebellar cortex and provide the only final output pathway of cerebellar processing. This corticonuclear pathway is mediated entirely by GABA inhibition via Purkinje cell (PC) axons, yet conveys important information regarding the fine temporal control of behavior. Therefore, the interesting question arises of how one can control finely tuned CN output spike patterns with inhibition, challenging our understanding of neural coding. Using the technique of dynamic clamp, artificial inhibitory synaptic input patterns can be applied to CN neurons to explore this question. It was found that a population code in which a set of PCs pause at the same time creates an efficient code to precisely trigger individual CN spikes via disinhibition. Strong inhibition can paradoxically also evoke spiking, namely, by a mechanism of postinhibitory rebound, a pronounced property of CN neurons. Strong bursts of PC activity followed by pauses of firing create an ideal stimulus for rebound generation and are elicited by synchronous climbing fiber inputs to cerebellar cortex. Such a stimulus-evoked rebound could trigger specific behavioral responses, though direct evidence for this mechanism is currently lacking. The conditioned eyeblink reflex in particular has been extensively studied with respect to learning mechanisms in the CN. Activity in the CN develops an increase just before the eyeblink during learning, and this CN activation depends on plasticity in the excitatory input to CN neurons by mossy fibers. Interestingly, this form of plasticity has been first predicted and then found to be controlled by the activity of inhibitory PC input. The cellular basis for this form of plasticity ultimately depends on a complex set of calcium signaling events during inputs in the required sequence of MF inputs followed by inhibition, followed by repolarization. A similar mechanism is proposed to also underlie the adaptation of vestibuloocular gain control coded by the vestibular nuclei. The involvement of similar or different learning mechanisms in the CN in more complex limb movement control remains to be determined, but behavioral and electrophysiological evidence points in the direction that the precise timing of predictive submovement activation in coordinated limb movements may be the predominant function of cerebellar output from the CN in this regard.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum and brainstem constitute the essential neural circuit responsible for the acquisition and expression of the classically conditioned eyeblink response in numerous mammalian species, including humans. In this simple form of motor learning, a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps and coterminates with a mildly aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), resulting, eventually, in the production of an eyeblink conditioned response (CR) to the CS alone. The forebrain is engaged when this basic delay procedure is made more difficult - for instance, if the CS and US are separated by a brief stimulus-free gap of time. In either case, it is generally accepted that the critical memory trace is formed and stored in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IP). The cerebellar cortex also plays a key role in normal acquisition by modulating the amplitude and/or timing characteristics of the eyeblink CR. Owing to the well-defined nature of the neural circuit, and the close correspondence between animal and human studies, eyeblink conditioning has been successfully used to investigate cerebellar dysfunction across a variety of human populations. Herein, research related to three representative disorders is discussed: fetal alcohol syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.

   abstract = {The inferior olive gives rise to the climbing fiber input to cerebellar Purkinje cells and is therefore the source of one of the most powerful synapses in the brain, generating a large burst of Purkinje cell activity referred to as the complex spike. The timing of complex spikes plays a key role in theories of cerebellar function and the determinants of the temporal output structure of neurons of the inferior olive are thus of critical importance. Olivary neurons display spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (STOs) that are generated by the interplay of intrinsic voltage- and calcium-gated conductances and electrotonic coupling between groups of neurons that consequently oscillate in synchrony. Olivary action potentials are also complex, consisting of an initial spike followed by a plateau potential that drives a burst of axonal action potentials. The STOs can influence the timing of spike output and the number of spikes in this burst, implicating them in important downstream effects in the cerebellar cortex, such as complex spike timing and synchrony, and synaptic plasticity. STOs and the coupling between olivary neurons can be modified by extrinsic input, a key candidate being the afferent inhibitory connections forming the descending limb of the olivocerebellar loop. This may result in an olivary network with dynamic properties, which has led to theories of the olivocerebellar system as a generator of spatiotemporal patterns of firing. This chapter discusses evidence for these and competing models, as well as their implications for the production of motor rhythms.},

These cerebellum-like structures are sensory structures that receive input from sensory receptors in their deep layers and input from a mossy fiber-granule cell-parallel fiber system in their molecular layers. This chapter describes these cerebellum-like structures and compares them with the cerebellum itself. Cerebellum-like structures in fish have been shown to act as adaptive sensory processors in which the signals conveyed by parallel fibers come to predict patterns of peripheral sensory input through a process of associative synaptic plasticity. The many similarities between cerebellum-like structures and the cerebellum itself suggest that the cerebellum may also generate predictions about expected sensory input patterns, as suggested also by clinical, experimental, and theoretical studies of the cerebellum. Hence, understanding the mechanisms for predicting sensory patterns in cerebellum-like structures may be a source of insight into cerebellar function.},

   abstract = {The traditional teaching that the cerebellum is purely a motor control device no longer appears to be valid, if indeed it ever was. Current evidence indicates that there is functional topographic organization in the cerebellum such that the cerebellar anterior lobe, adjacent part of lobule VI, and lobule VIII and their associated nuclei are principally engaged with motor control. In contrast, the great expanse of the cerebellar posterior lobe (lobules VI and VII) and associated nuclei are engaged in the modulation of supramodal, higher order functions. This connectional and functional arrangement manifests clinically in two overarching clinical syndromes. Lesions of the motor cerebellum result in the cerebellar motor syndrome of Ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, and oculomotor abnormalities. Lesions of the cognitive and limbic cerebellum lead to the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), both in adults and in children, characterized by impairments in executive function, visual-spatial processing, linguistic deficits, and affective dysregulation. The affective component of the CCAS, conceptualized as the neuropsychiatry of the cerebellum, has been grouped according to five major domains: attentional control, emotional control, autism spectrum disorders, psychosis spectrum disorders, and social skill set. Within each of these domains, behaviors may reflect cognitive overshoot or undershoot, akin to the disorder of motor control seen in the cerebellar motor syndrome. This chapter focuses on the behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry of the cerebellum in a number of different disease states, and draws attention to the fact that this rapidly evolving field of neuroscience has clinically relevant ramifications for adults, children, and infants with cerebellar dysfunction. This chapter aims to enhance the recognition of the CCAS and its theoretical underpinnings, and to highlight the promise these new insights hold for novel interventions in patients with neurobehavioral and psychiatric disease linked to the cerebellum.},

Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum come in many different subtypes, organized first into four transverse zones and then further grouped into hundreds of reproducible topographical units - stripes. Stripes are identified by their functional properties, connectivity, and expression profiles. The molecular pattern of stripes is highly reproducible between individuals and conserved through evolution. Pattern formation in the cerebellar cortex is a multistage process that begins with the generation of the Purkinje cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fourth ventricle. During this stage or shortly after, Purkinje cell subtypes are specified toward specific positions. Purkinje cells migrate from the VZ to form an array of clusters that form the framework for cerebellar topography. At around birth these clusters disperse, triggered by a Reelin signaling pathway, to form the adult stripe array. The chapter will begin with a brief overview of adult cerebellar topography, primarily focusing on the mouse cerebellum, and then discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms that establish these remarkable patterns.},

   abstract = {Despite the idea that cerebellar input into cognition is a new concept, looking back in history one can see that this function of the cerebellum has long been discussed and was merely forgotten in the middle of the last century! Over the last several decades, the importance of the cerebellum in cognitive development has been shown in many areas. Children who suffer from congenital cerebellar malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia or Joubert syndrome experience, in addition to motor problems, marked cognitive deficits. The degree of congenital or early acquired cerebellar damage is related to the degree of developmental problems later, as shown for preterm babies. There are many childhood developmental problems, such as fragile X syndrome, ADHD, dyslexia, and autism, where it can be shown that the degree of cerebellar structural abnormalities relates to cognitive deficits. In later acquired problems, such as infratentorial brain tumors or strokes, and late-onset cerebellar disorders, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia or Louis-Bar syndrome, data show the importance of an intact cerebellum for the normal development of children. The degree of cerebellar atrophy in children after brain trauma or oncological treatments is a prognostic signpost for cognitive problems. Recent functional neuroimaging data support these clinical observations: the posterior lobe and lobule VI of the cerebellum seem to be involved in higher-level tasks such as verbal and working memory and executive functions. There are also data supporting a lateralized function: logical reasoning and language processing on the right side and visuospatial and attentional skills on the left side of the cerebellum. In summary, normal development of cognition seems to depend on an active interplay between cerebrum and cerebellum. The earlier in life and the more pronounced the disturbance of this interplay, the more the cognitive development of these children is hindered.},

Current models built upon the idea that the cerebellum may work as a monitoring system integrating different aspects of limbic and cortical information processing and provides feedback to these brain areas to direct behavior.

This is an important gap in understanding because anatomical connectivity is a key determinant of cerebellar function. This chapter focuses on recent advances in understanding the anatomical and physiological properties of cerebro-cerebellar connections in nonhuman species. There are two main routes by which cerebral information can gain access to the cerebellum: cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways that terminate in the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers and cerebro-olivocerebellar pathways that terminate as climbing fibers. A common principle of organization seems to be the convergence of somatotopically corresponding pathways, with the climbing fiber system playing a key role in imposing this order. In addition to this well-ordered spatial arrangement, there is also precise timing of integration of ascending and descending inputs. The spatial and temporal congruence of inputs is consistent with the one-map hypothesis of cerebellar organization (Apps and Hawkes 2009). The functional significance of this precise arrangement remains to be determined but is likely to have a major impact on cerebellar activity.},

   abstract = {The vestibular system projects onto the cerebellum via three major pathways that are composed of primary and secondary vestibular mossy fiber afferents and tertiary vestibular climbing fibers. Vestibular primary afferent mossy fibers project to the ipsilateral uvula-nodulus (folia 9d and 10). Secondary vestibular mossy fibers originate from three of the five vestibular nuclei: medial, descending, and superior (MVN, DVN, and SVN). These mossy fibers terminate in the uvula-nodulus and flocculus. The MVN, DVN, and SVN receive convergent vestibular, optokinetic, and neck proprioceptive information. Vestibular tertiary afferents originate from two subnuclei of the inferior olive, the β-nucleus and dorsomedial cell column (DMCC), and send climbing fibers to the contralateral uvula-nodulus. The β-nucleus and DMCC receive direct projections from the parasolitary nucleus (Psol). The Psol, β-nucleus, and DMCC convey information to the cerebellum from the vertical semicircular canals and otoliths, but not from the horizontal semicircular canals. Climbing fiber projections are arrayed in sagittal zones, establishing a mediolateral map on the uvula-nodulus of the 180° of possible head angles during roll-tilt. Signals conveyed from climbing fibers are preeminent in modulating the discharge of both complex and simple spikes (CSs and SSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells. This discharge is fed back onto a fraction of neurons in the dorsal aspect of the descending and medial vestibular nuclei as well as the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus. The vestibulocerebellum imposes a climbing fiber-constructed coordinate system on postural responses and permits adaptive guidance of movement.},

   abstract = {Important insights into cerebellar function can be gained from an anatomical analysis of cerebellar output. Recent studies using transsynaptic tracers in nonhuman primates demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum targets multiple nonmotor areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex, as well as the motor areas of the cerebral cortex. The projections to different neocortical areas originate from distinct output channels within the cerebellar nuclei. The neocortical area that is the main target of each output channel is a major source of input to the channel. Thus, a closed-loop circuit represents the fundamental macro-architectural unit of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. The outputs of these circuits provide the cerebellum with the anatomical substrate to influence the control of movement and cognition. Similarly, it has been shown that discrete multisynaptic loops connect the basal ganglia with motor and nonmotor areas of the cerebral cortex. Interactions between cerebro-cerebellar and cerebro-basal ganglia loops have been thought to occur mainly at the level of the neocortex. More recently, neuroanatomical studies demonstrate that the anatomical substrate exists for substantial interactions between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in both the motor and nonmotor domains. These data, along with the revelations about cerebro-cerebellar circuitry, provide a new framework for exploring the contribution of the cerebellum to diverse aspects of behavior.},

Conversely, the different cortical afferences to the BPN and the NRTP, as well as the anatomical and functional features of the cerebellopetal projections from these pontine nuclei, support the different, and for some aspect, complementary arrangement of the cerebrocerebellar pathways relayed by the BPN or NRTP. Both the BPN and the NRTP are innervated from the cerebral cortex, but with regional prevalence. The NRTP is principally innervated from motor or sensori-motor areas while the BPN are principally innervated from sensory, mainly teloceptive, and associative area. Projections from sensory-motor areas were also traced to the BPN. The BPN and NRTP project to all parts of the cerebellar cortex with a similar pattern. In fact, from single areas of them projections were traced to set of sagittal stripes of the cerebellar cortex. In variance to such analogies, the projections to the cerebellar nuclei differed between those traced from the NRTP and from BPN. In fact, BPN and NRTP have private terminal areas in the cerebellar nuclei with relatively little overlaps. The BPN innervated the lateroventral part of the nucleus lateralis and the caudoventral aspect of the nucleus interpositalis posterioris. The NRTP principally innervated the mediodorsal part of the nucleus lateralis, the nucleus interpositalis anterioris, the nucleus medialis. Since the single cerebellar nuclei have their specific targets in the extracerebellar brain areas, it follows that the BPN and the NRTP, passing through their cerebellar nuclei relays, are devoted to control different brain areas and thus likely to play different functional roles. From single pontine regions (of both BPN and NRTP) projections were traced to the cerebellar cortex and to the cerebellar nuclei. In some cases these projections reached areas which are likely anatomically connected (by Purkinje axons). This pattern of the pontine projections was termed as coupled projection. In some other cases, the projections reached areas of the cerebellar cortex but not the nuclear regions innervated by them. We termed this as uncoupled projection. The existence of both coupled and uncoupled projections, open new vistas on the functional architecture of the pontocerebellar pathway. More in detail, this study showed the different quantitative and topographic distribution of the coupled and uncoupled projections visualized in the cerebellar projections from BPN and NRTP. All these evidences strongly support the anatomical and the functional differences that characterise the cerebrocerebellar pathways relayed by the BPN and the NRTP.},

Oculomotor physiologists have tackled these questions using an exemplar model for motor control, eye movement, and a multifaceted approach consisting of correlation of structure and function, effects of lesions, neuronal recordings, and model simulations. This chapter reviews the literature and provides evidence that the cerebellum exerts control over all types of eye movements and that this control is distributed such that different regions of the cerebellum are more or less specialized in different types of eye movements. In addition to the online control of eye movements, the cerebellum plays a key role in motor learning of eye movements. Unifying theories of motor control built in part thanks to the data presented in this chapter suggest that the cerebellum is part of the neuronal circuit responsible for constructing predictions of the consequences of the motor command signal, prediction that are necessary for fine movement control.},

Yet, or perhaps for this reason, the computational significance of this circuitry remains a very active subject of discussion and debate, with even basic assumptions regarding the physiological organization of this circuit now being questioned. Specifically, while most current models of molecular layer circuitry assume that parallel fiber excitatory synaptic input directly drives Purkinje cells to fire, there is growing experimental evidence that this might not be the case. Recent model-based efforts to better understand the functional role of the parallel fiber system suggest that molecular layer inhibition may play a larger and more complex physiological role than previously realized. In turn, this reanalysis of the role of inhibition in cerebellar cortical circuitry suggests that the cerebellar molecular layer may implement a sensory-related contextual algorithm, rather than either a timing or associative learning function previously assumed to provide the basis for a cerebellar involvement in motor coordination.},

It is now accepted that the cerebellum acts as a cognitive operator in learning, perception, and attention. Moreover, major improvements in our assessment of in vivo cerebellar architecture using imaging techniques have occurred. A typical example is the accurate description of cerebellar anatomy during fetal development with MRI, a progress which has direct impacts on patient care. These advances have been associated with discoveries of new clinical disorders, in particular in the field of genetic Ataxias. More than 20 new genes have been identified these last 10 years. Only for dominant Ataxias, more than 30 diseases have now been unravelled. The number of ataxic disorders will increase with aging, the cerebellum being the structure of the brain with the most important loss of neurons with age. More than 300 different cerebellar disorders are encountered during daily practice, but we are missing a single source of information explaining their pathogenesis. Despite the immense amount of knowledge acquired about the cerebellar circuitry these last years, a large book covering the neuroscience of the cerebellum is missing.

Additionally, fcMRI permits an anatomical parcellation of the neocerebellum based on its specific functional links with the associative cortex. Lobules V, VII, IX, and especially crus I and II constitute a supramodal cognitive zone specifically interconnected with prefrontal, parietal, and cingulate neocortices. Structural connectivity using DTI-based tractography complements fcMRI data and confirms anatomical connections between the dentate nucleus, thalamus, and associative cortices. Taken together, these results support the theory that specific neocerebellar subregions are key nodes in parallel, multisynaptic, closed-loop circuits involved in executive, mnemonic, and affective functions.},

   abstract = {Adaptive-filter models are widely used to understand cerebellar function. Major features include the resemblance between their basic structure and that of the cerebellar cortical microcircuit, their use of a simple decorrelation algorithm known to be effective for processing physical signals, and their capacity to be connected appropriately for predicting the sensory consequences of movement commands, and for learning accurate movements. One method for evaluating adaptive-filter models is to examine the input-output signals of individual cerebellar microzones: current evidence suggests that the flocculus can act like an adaptive filter, but the relevant information is available for few other regions. A second method is to examine microcircuit features for compatibility with the model. A key task for this form of evaluation is deciding how far the apparently incompatibility of features signifies (1) experimental artifact, (2) the unsuspected requirements of an adaptive filter when it is implemented neurally, or (3) the operation of a new algorithm. Adaptive-filter models have thus the potential for guiding both future experimental and modeling studies.},

As a consequence, the integration of inputs to olivary neurons as well as their intrinsic properties are critical for cerebellar function. In this chapter, all issues that are relevant for their ultimate function are addressed. This chapter starts by reviewing developmental aspects such as the origin and migratory routes of inferior olivary neurons and a description of their axonal outgrowth into climbing fibers innervating Purkinje cells. Subsequently, a detailed description of the olivary subdivisions and the ultrastructure of their neuropil is provided. This is characterized by the presence of dendro-dendritic gap junctions located in glomeruli and by the consistently combined excitatory and inhibitory innervation of their coupled spines. Furthermore, the electrophysiological behavior of olivary neurons is described and discussed. Finally, these unique properties are integrated in cellular and system models. Both type of models show that the inferior olive is very well able to control both rate coding and spatiotemporal pattern coding of their postsynaptic target neurons in the cerebellar cortex, cerebellar nuclei, and vestibular nuclei. Abnormalities in their firing properties can contribute to syndromes such as Ataxia, palatomyoclonus, and possibly also autism.},

While considered as a single neuronal class, separate from Lugaro cells, Golgi cells form a highly heterogeneous population, both morphologically and immunohistochemically. Golgi cells are interconnected by electrical synapses and connected to other cortical cell types by chemical synapses, forming feedforward and feedback inhibitory loops onto granule cells. Golgi cells are thus ideally placed to control the gain and temporal pattern of granule cell discharge in response to afferent mossy fiber activity. In vivo Golgi cells fire irregularly and respond to peripheral stimuli with brief burst responses or prolonged pauses. In the behaving animal, the firing rate of Golgi cells is modulated and forms sensory-motor receptive fields. Furthermore, Golgi cell activity is coordinated with local field potential oscillations in the beta range both locally and along the parallel fiber beams. Detailed computer models have been generated and predict complex oscillatory behaviors of the granule cell layer network at various frequencies. The impact of these oscillations on the encoding capacity of the granular layer is still debated, and further recordings are needed to understand how Golgi cells affect granule cell spike timing.},

The differential influence of prefrontal, motor, or parietal areas in combination with cerebellar areas, especially within the posterior hemispheres, on the control of eye and hand movements is not very well defined. Using fMRI we investigated the functional representation of isolated or combined eye and hand movements within the cerebellum and the impact of differential cognitive preload on the activation patterns. Each task consisted of the performance of saccades or hand movements triggered by a cue presented on a screen in front of the scanner. Saccades were tested for visually guided saccades, triple step saccades, and for visuospatial memory. Sequential finger opposition movements were tested for predictive and nonpredictive movements. Combined and isolated eye-hand reaching movements were tested toward a target presented in 5 different horizontal positions. Visually guided saccades activated the cerebellar vermis lobuli VI-VII, triple step saccades, including visuospatial memorization, in addition the cerebellar hemispheres lobuli VII-VIII. Sequential finger movements and reaching movements activated a cerebellar network consisting of the lobuli IV-VI, the vermis, and the lobuli VII-VIII with broader areas and additional regions especially within the lobus VII for more complex movements. The combined in contrast to the isolated performance of eye and hand movements demonstrated specialized activation foci within the cerebellar vermis and posterior hemispheres. We could demonstrate a differential representation of eye and hand movements within the cerebellum. Additional "cognitive" preload within a given task leads to additional activation of the posterior cerebellar hemispheres, with a subspecialization corresponding to premotor and parietal area connections.},

Cells displaying a somewhat irregular, syncopated cadence of spontaneous activity averaging 4-10 Hz could, upon successful entrainment and visualization, be morphologically identified as Golgi cells. Spontaneously firing cells with a highly or fairly regular firing rate of 10-35 Hz turned out to be unipolar brush cells. We also found indications that other types of cerebellar cortical neurons might also be distinguished on the basis of the characteristics of their spontaneous firing. Comparison of the interspike interval histograms of spontaneous activity obtained in the anaesthetized rat with those obtained in the awake rabbit points to a way whereby the behaviorally related modulation of specific types of interneurons can be studied. In particular, the spontaneous activity signatures of Golgi cells and unipolar brush cells anatomically identified in the uvula/nodulus of the anaesthetized rat are remarkably similar to the spontaneous activity patterns of some units we have recorded in the flocculus of the awake rabbit. The spontaneous activity patterns of at least some types of cerebellar interneurons clearly have the potential to serve as identifying signatures in behaving animals.},

Cerebellar output is directed to the diencephalon and to a score of brainstem regions. This chapter reviews the cerebellar nuclear projections to the brainstem areas that give rise to descending connections that can influence motor programming at spinal cord level, i.e., the reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, rubrospinal, tectospinal, and interstitiospinal pathways. In addition, cerebellar projections to other areas will be briefly considered. Although cerebellar output is structured by the modular internal organization of cerebellar circuitry and related olivocerebellar connections, it is concluded that the modular output, that is, output of individual cerebellar nuclei or parts thereof, still reaches many areas in the brainstem and diencephalon. In addition, multiple modules may converge their outputs indirectly to the same muscles. This suggests that multiple modules may each take part in different aspects of control of the same muscle or muscle group. Conversely, individual modules, due to the distributed nature of their outputs, may simultaneously affect several descending motor systems with the same ensuing goal. More detailed anatomical and physiological studies will be necessary to explore these possibilities.},

The anatomical connections between the cerebellum, spinal cord, and sensorimotor and association areas of the cerebral cortex suggest a functional topography exists within the human cerebellum, such that different cerebellar regions are part of distributed spinocerebellar and cerebro-cerebellar circuits. This concept is supported by data from functional imaging studies, in which regional activation patterns differ for sensorimotor vs. cognitive and affective task paradigms. Here these neuroimaging data are reviewed and both cross-task comparisons and within-task topography are considered. The evidence indicates that cerebellar activation patterns are related to the specific demands of a given task, and the localization of the activation patterns reflects the engagement of different cerebro-cerebellar circuits. Establishing cerebellar functional topography in humans has important implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data, the understanding of clinical outcomes in cerebellar damage or disease, and the broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in motor and cognitive function.},

The introduction of high-resolution structural brain imaging and new analysis methods has lead to significant improvement in the ability to draw such conclusions. Lesion-symptom mapping is now possible with a spatial resolution at the level of individual lobules and nuclei of the cerebellum. The investigation of patients with defined focal lesions yields the greatest potential for obtaining meaningful correlations between lesion site and behavioral deficits. In smaller groups of patients, overlay plots and subtraction analysis are good options. If larger groups of patients are available, different statistical techniques have been introduced to compare behavior and lesion site on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Although localization in degenerative cerebellar disorders is less accurate because of the diffuse nature of the disease, certain information about the supposed function of larger subdivisions of the cerebellum can be gained. This review highlights the current developments of lesion-symptom mapping in human cerebellar lesion studies. Examples are given which show that meaningful correlations between lesion site and behavioral data can be obtained both in patients with degenerative as well as focal cerebellar disorders.},

Using stereological principles, the total number of neurones on one side in the pontine nuclei was estimated to be 490 000 (mean; n= 6). Thus, approximately 4% of the total number of neurones in the pontine nuclei would project to a single parafloccular folium. Assuming that the highest estimates of labelled cells are the most representative, the proportion would be 9%. Considering that the volume injected makes up a tiny fraction of the total cerebellar cortical volume, these figures reflect an extreme convergence. After injections in adjacent folia we observed 19-27% double labelling. The double labelling frequency dropped steeply with increasing distance between injections. The strong convergence and limited local axonal branching suggest the existence of extensive branching to widely separated cerebellar regions.},

However, six major issues revealing a discrepancy between morphologically inspired hypothesis and function have emerged. (1) The cerebellar granular layer does not simply operate a simple combinatorial decorrelation of the inputs but performs more complex non-linear spatio-temporal transformations and is endowed with synaptic plasticity. (2) Transmission along the ascending axon and parallel fibers does not lead to beam formation but rather to vertical columns of activation. (3) The olivo-cerebellar loop could perform complex timing operations rather than error detection and teaching. (4) Purkinje cell firing dynamics are much more complex than for a linear integrator and include pacemaking, burst-pause discharges, and bistable states in response to mossy and climbing fiber synaptic inputs. (5) Long-term synaptic plasticity is far more complex than traditional parallel fiber LTD and involves also other cerebellar synapses. (6) Oscillation and resonance could set up coherent cycles of activity designing a functional geometry that goes far beyond pre-wired anatomical circuits. These observations clearly show that structure is not sufficient to explain function and that a precise knowledge on dynamics is critical to understand how the cerebellar circuit operates. © 2010.},

Inverse models are held to allow the system to determine the motor commands necessary to achieve a desired state, while forward models are held to allow the system to predict the expected sensory feedback of a motor command, allowing rapid error detection when actual and predicted feedback do not match. It has recently been suggested that these ideas from control theory might also be applied to the control of cognitive processes, allowing (for example) the cognitive system to anticipate processing conflict and pre-emptively minimise it by adjusting processing strategies or the allocation of processing resources. 12 This paper reviews theories of cognitive control that are broadly consistent with the use of complementary forward and inverse models. It is argued that there is indeed a role for such models in cognitive control-particularly in relation to a putative monitoring function-but that the models involved are likely to be somewhat impoverished.},

Even though the vast majority of pontine neurons send their axons to the cerebellar cortex, and are contacted monosynaptically by (glutamatergic) corticopontine fibers, the information-processing taking place is not well understood. In addition to typical projection neurons, the pontine nuclei contain putative GABA-ergic interneurons and complex synaptic arrangements. The cortico-pontine projection is characterized by a precise but highly divergent terminal pattern. Large and functionally diverse parts of the cerebral cortex contribute; in the monkey the most notable exception is the almost total lack of projections from large parts of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Within corticopontine projections from visual and somatosensory areas there is a de-emphasis of central vision and distal parts of the extremities as compared with other connections of these sensory areas. Subcorticopontine projections provide only a few percent of the total input to the pontine nuclei. Certain cell groups, such as the reticular formation, project in a diffuse manner whereas other nuclei, such as the mammillary nucleus, project to restricted pontine regions only, partially converging with functionally related corticopontine connections. The pontocerebellar projection is characterized by a highly convergent pattern, even though there is also marked divergence. Neurons projecting to a single cerebellar folium appear to be confined to a lamella-shaped volume in the pontine nuclei. The organization of the pontine nuclei suggests that they ensure that information from various, functionally diverse, parts of the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei are brought together and integrated in the cerebellar cortex.

Although it has a uniform cellular structure in mammals and birds, there is great variability in the relative size of its parts. In mammals the cerebellum can be roughly divided into three parasagittal divisions; a midline vermis (Latin: a worm) and two lateral hemispheres. The hemispheres are large in the higher primates and they are very large in the human brain. Because the cerebellar hemispheres are particularly large in humans and the higher primates, from time to time claims have been made that in addition to its role in motor control, the cerebellum is important for cognitive functions, such as learning, attention, and language. Here I review some of the evidence for and against that claim. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Internal models for motor control and trajectory planning Kawato 719 in the trajectories and large end-point errors. During repeated trials, the inverse dynamics model changes to the inverse of the combined arm dynamics and the applied force field. Then, normal trajectories reappear and the end-point errors are reduced. This adaptation is assumed to involve plastic changes of the synaptic efficacy of neu-rons constituting the inverse dynamics model. With the sudden removal of the applied force field, however, the inverse dynamics model continues to generate the motor commands to compensate for the arm dynamics, as well as the non-existing force field, and this leads to distortions in the trajectories in the opposite direction. The most convincing set of data for the existence of forward models comes from studies on coordination between reaching and grasping. When an object is held with the tips of the index finger and thumb on either side (Figure 2a), the grip force is precisely controlled (Figure 2b) so that, under normal conditions, it is just slightly greater than the minimum grip force needed to prevent slip [8]; this is also so when the arm dynamics is altered by a robot [9]. Such a grip-force-load-force coupling is explained by a framework that contains both the inverse and forward models of the arm, as shown in Figure 2c. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed cerebellar activity specific to grip-force-load-force coupling [10 • ], suggesting the existence of forward models in the cerebellum. In principle, the scheme shown in Figure 2c can be generalized to the coordination of any combined movements (e.g. eye and hand movement, or right-hand movement and left-hand movement) in any part of the body. Oculomanual coordination [11 •• ], and bi-manual tracking (E Nakano, DM Wolpert, personal communications) are examples. Internal models were also studied in the sensory system for processes other than motor control. The vestibular system is composed of semicircular canals, which report any angular acceleration, and otolith organs, which respond to any linear acceleration. Because the otolith responds to both the occurrence of linear acceleration and gravity, it is com-putationally difficult to analyse the ambiguous sensory information [12]. Through the use of dexterously designed vestibular stimuli and the examination of resulting eye movements in monkeys [13] and humans [14], internal models have been suggested to estimate linear acceleration and gravity from the canal and otolith outputs. This internal model can be classified as an inverse model of the sensor physics with acceleration and gravity as its inputs. The necessity for internal models in motor control has been one of the central issues of debate in relation to equilibrium point control. Muscle and peripheral reflex loops have spring-like properties that pull joints back to their equilibrium positions by generating a restoring force against external perturbations. This viscoelasticity can be regarded as peripheral feedback control gain, which is adjustable by regulating the associated muscle co-contraction level and reflex gain. It has been hypothesized that by exploiting this Figure 1 Feedback and feedforward control using an inverse model of a controlled object. (a) In feedback control, the realized trajectory is compared with the desired trajectory, and the error is computed. The feedback motor command is generated from this error using a relatively simple algorithm, such as a proportional, integral and derivative feedback controller. In robotics, almost all practical applications depend solely on feedback controls. This is because feedback delays in artificial systems can be made small; hence, sampling and control frequencies can be quite high (from 500-10000 Hz). In biological motor control, however, the delay is very large. For visual feedback on arm movements, the delay ranges from 150-250 ms. Relatively fast spinal feedback loops still require 30-50 ms time delays. These are very large compared with the movement duration of very fast (150 ms) to intermediate (500 ms) movements. Because time delay occupies a large proportion of movement execution time, and feedback gains cannot be set high because of instability due to large delays, fast and smooth movements cannot be executed depending solely on feedback control. Muscle intrinsic mechanical properties produce proportional (stiffness) and derivative (viscosity) gains without delay. However, these viscoelasticities are small for well-trained movements [21,23 • ]. (b) If an inverse dynamics model is serially-connected with the controlled object, the serial system gives a mathematical identity function. That is, the output (i.e. the realized trajectory) is identical to the input (i.e. the desired trajectory). Thus, the inverse model, if it exists and can be learned, becomes an ideal feedforward controller. In biological systems with large feedback delays and small feedback gains, internal models are the only computational possibility for fast and well coordinated movements. Even for artificial robotic systems, if reduction gears are not used (e.g. direct drive motors, artificial muscles, hydraulic actuators), inverse models are required (see, for example, the URL},

   abstract = {The mystery of the human cerebellum is this: Why did it enlarge so dramatically in the last million years of human evolution, concomitantly with the greater enlargement of the cerebral cortex? A solution to this mystery was proposed in the 20th century as a result of research by several groups of scientists who investigated the contributions of the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex. In contrast to the 19th century investigations, which were focused on the motor functions of the cerebellum, the focus of the subsequent investigations was expanded to include some mental functions because evidence was produced that the cerebellum contributes to cognition. It was proposed that the combination in the cerebellum of motor and mental capabilities enables the cerebellum to confer on humans some adaptive advantages of great value, and this ability would explain why the human cerebellum has continued to enlarge so dramatically. A valuable adaptive advantage that is included in the proposal is the possibility that the cerebellum couples the motor function of articulating speech to the mental function that selects the language to be spoken, thus helping to produce fluent human speech and language. The validity of this proposal about linguistic processing has not yet been verified. Therefore the mystery of cerebellar enlargement in humans is not yet solved and requires further research. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It is a poor candidate to reverse LTD because it is presynaptically expressed whereas LTD is postsynaptic. We now characterize a new form of LTP induced by 1 Hz PF stimulation for at least 300 s.

LTD, saturated by repeated induction protocols, can be reversed by a single round of postsynaptic LTP or nitric oxide (NO), enabling LTD to be reinduced. Conversely, after postsynaptic LTP has been saturated, one round of LTD permits fresh postsyn-aptic LTP. By contrast, after saturation of LTD, induction of pre-synaptic LTP or application of forskolin leaves LTD still saturated. Likewise, presynaptic LTP cannot be reversed by LTD.

The finding that Purkinje cell activity changed in many sensori-motor calibration tasks was taken as strong support for this hypothesis. Based on more recent data, however, it has been suggested that changes in Purkinje cell activity do not contribute to the motor command directly; instead, they are used either as a teaching signal, or to predict the altered kinematics of the movement after calibration has taken place. I will argue that these roles are not mutually exclusive, and that Purkinje cells may contribute to command generation, teaching, and prediction at different times during sensori-motor calibration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We aimed to assess the long-term outcome in children with severe unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia (UCH). Method: As part of a retrospective study we describe neuroimaging features, clinical findings, and cognitive outcomes of seven children with UCH (five males, two females; age at first magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]: median 1y 3mo, range 9d-8y 10mo; age at latest follow-up: median 6y 6mo, range 2y 3mo-14y 11mo). Results: One child had abnormalities on prenatal MRI at 21 weeks' gestation. The left cerebellar hemisphere was affected in five children, and the right hemisphere in two children. The vermis was involved in five children. The volume of the posterior fossa was variable. At the latest follow-up, neurological findings included truncal ataxia and muscular hypotonia in five children, limb ataxia in three patients, and head nodding in two patients. Three children had learning disability*, five had speech and language disorders, and one had a severe behavioural disorder. Interpretation: Severe UCH is a residual change after a disruptive prenatal cerebellar insult, most likely haemorrhagic. The outcome is variable, ranging from almost normal development to marked developmental impairment. Ataxia is a frequent but not a leading sign. It seems that involvement of the cerebellar vermis is often, but not consistently, associated with a poorer cognitive outcome, whereas an intact vermis is associated with normal outcome and no truncal ataxia. © The Authors.

In this study, we demonstrate how the cerebrocerebellar circuit develops both functionally and anatomically from childhood to adulthood in the typically developing human brain. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while a total of 57 right-handed, blindfolded, healthy children (aged 8–11 years), adolescents (aged 12–15 years), and young adults (aged 18–23 years) (n = 19 per group) performed alternating extension–flexion movements of their right wrists in precise synchronization with 1-Hz audio tones. We also collected their diffusion MR images to examine the extent of fiber maturity in cerebrocerebellar afferent and efferent tracts by evaluating the anisotropy-sensitive index of hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA). During the motor task, although the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortices were consistently activated across all age groups, the functional connectivity between these two distant regions was stronger in adults than in children and adolescents, whereas connectivity within the local cerebellum was stronger in children and adolescents than in adults. The HMOA values in cerebrocerebellar afferent and efferent tracts were higher in adults than in children (some were also higher than in adolescents). The results indicate that adult-like cerebrocerebellar functional coupling is not completely achieved during childhood and adolescence, even for fundamental sensorimotor brain function, probably due to anatomical immaturity of cerebrocerebellar tracts. This study clearly demonstrated the principle of “local-to-distant” development of functional brain networks in the human cerebrocerebellar sensorimotor network.},

There is mounting evidence that it might also play a critical role in non-motor functions such as cognition and emotion. It is therefore not surprising that cerebellar defects are associated with a wide array of diseases including ataxia, dystonia, tremor, schizophrenia, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorder. What is intriguing is that a seemingly uniform circuit that is often described as being “simple” should carry out all of these behaviors. Analyses of how cerebellar circuits develop have revealed that such descriptions massively underestimate the complexity of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is in fact highly patterned and organized around a series of parasagittal stripes and transverse zones. This topographic architecture partitions all cerebellar circuits into functional modules that are thought to enhance processing power during cerebellar dependent behaviors. What are arguably the most remarkable features of cerebellar topography are the developmental processes that produce them. This review is concerned with the genetic and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate cerebellar patterning. We place a major focus on how Purkinje cells control multiple aspects of cerebellar circuit assembly. Using this model, we discuss evidence for how “zebra-like” patterns in Purkinje cells sculpt the cerebellum, how specific genetic cues mediate the process, and how activity refines the patterns into an adult map that is capable of executing various functions. We also discuss how defective Purkinje cell patterning might impact the pathogenesis of neurological conditions.},

Networks with few synaptic connections per neuron and network-activity-dependent threshold were optimal for lossless sparse encoding over the widest range of input activities. Biologically detailed spiking network models with experimentally constrained synaptic conductances and inhibition confirmed our analytical predictions.

Differences in cerebellar function are thought to arise primarily through distinct patterns of input and output connectivity rather than as a result of variations in cortical microcircuitry. However, evidence from anatomical, physiological and genetic studies is increasingly challenging this orthodoxy, and there are now various lines of evidence indicating that the cerebellar cortex is not uniform. Here, we develop the hypothesis that regional differences in properties of cerebellar cortical microcircuits lead to important differences in information processing.},

   abstract = {The topography of the cerebellar cortex is described by at least three different maps, with the basic units of each map termed "microzones," "patches," and "bands." These are defined, respectively, by different patterns of climbing fiber input, mossy fiber input, and Purkinje cell (PC) phenotype. Based on embryological development, the "one-map" hypothesis proposes that the basic units of each map align in the adult animal and the aim of the present study was to test this possibility. In barbiturate anesthetized adult rats, nanoinjections of bidirectional tracer (Retrobeads and biotinylated dextran amine) were made into somatotopically identified regions within the hindlimb C1 zone in copula pyramidis. Injection sites were mapped relative to PC bands defined by the molecular marker zebrin II and were correlated with the pattern of retrograde cell labeling within the inferior olive and in the basilar pontine nuclei to determine connectivity of microzones and patches, respectively, and also with the distributions of biotinylated dextran amine-labeled PC terminals in the cerebellar nuclei. Zebrin bands were found to be related to both climbing fiber and mossy fiber inputs and also to cortical representation of different parts of the ipsilateral hindpaw, indicating a precise spatial organization within cerebellar microcircuitry. This precise connectivity extends to PC terminal fields in the cerebellar nuclei and olivonuclear projections. These findings strongly support the one-map hypothesis and suggest that, at the microcircuit level of resolution, the cerebellar cortex has a common plan of spatial organization for major inputs, outputs, and PC phenotype. © 2013 the authors.},

   abstract = {Substantial portions of the cerebellum appear to support non-motor functions; however, previous investigations of cerebellar involvement in cognition have revealed only a coarse degree of specificity. Although somatotopic maps have been observed within cerebellum, similar precision within cortico-cerebellar networks supporting non-motor functions has not previously been reported. Here, we find that human cerebellar lobule VIIb/VIIIa differentially codes key aspects of visuospatial cognition. Ipsilateral visuospatial representations were observed during both a visual working memory and an attentionally demanding visual receptive field-mapping fMRI task paradigm. Moreover, within lobule VIIb/VIIIa, we observed a functional dissociation between spatial coding and visual working memory processing. Visuospatial representations were found in the dorsomedial portion of lobule VIIb/VIIIa, and load-dependent visual working memory processing was shifted ventrolaterally. A similar functional gradient for spatial versus load processing was found in posterior parietal cortex. This cerebral cortical organization was well predicted by functional connectivity with spatial and load regions of cerebellar lobule VIIb/VIIIa. Collectively, our findings indicate that recruitment by visuospatial attentional functions within cerebellar lobule VIIb/VIIIa is highly specific. Furthermore, the topographic arrangement of these functions is mirrored in frontal and parietal cortex. These findings motivate a closer examination of cortico-cerebellar functional specialization across a broad range of cognitive domains. Brissenden et al. demonstrate precise cerebellar contributions to visual cognitive processing and establish the existence of two cortico-cerebellar subnetworks that support different aspects of visuospatial cognition. This topographic specificity suggests that fine-grained cortico-cerebellar loops play a prominent role in cognitive processing.},

   abstract = {Spike trains are rich in information that can be extracted to guide behaviors at millisecond time resolution or across longer time intervals. In sensory systems, the information usually is defined with respect to the stimulus. Especially in motor systems, however, it is equally critical to understand how spike trains predict behavior. Thus, our goal was to compare systematically spike trains in the oculomotor system with eye movement behavior on single movements. We analyzed the discharge of Purkinje cells in the floccular complex of the cerebellum, floccular target neurons in the brainstem, other vestibular neurons, and abducens neurons. We find that an extra spike in a brief analysis window predicts a substantial fraction of the trial-by-trial variation in the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements. For Purkinje cells, a single extra spike in a 40 ms analysis window predicts, on average, 0.5 SDs of the variation in behavior. An optimal linear estimator predicts behavioral variation slightly better than do spike counts in brief windows. Simulations reveal that the ability of single spikes to predict a fraction of behavior also emerges from model spike trains that have the same statistics as the real spike trains, as long as they are driven by shared sensory inputs. We think that the shared sensory estimates in their inputs create correlations in neural spiking across time and across each population. As a result, one or a small number of spikes in a brief time interval can predict a substantial fraction of behavioral variation.},

Motor thalamus receives excitatory input from the cerebellum, which learns to generate predictive signals for motor control. The contribution of this pathway to neocortical preparatory signals remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, in a virtual reality conditioning task, cerebellar output neurons in the dentate nucleus exhibit preparatory activity similar to that in anterolateral motor cortex prior to reward acquisition. Silencing activity in dentate nucleus by photoactivating inhibitory Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex caused robust, short-latency suppression of preparatory activity in anterolateral motor cortex. Our results suggest that preparatory activity is controlled by a learned decrease of Purkinje cell firing in advance of reward under supervision of climbing fiber inputs signaling reward delivery. Thus, cerebellar computations exert a powerful influence on preparatory activity in motor neocortex. Chabrol et al. show that the cerebellum is directly involved in maintaining preparatory activity in the premotor neocortex during learned, goal-directed behavior. Their results suggest the cerebellum provides a learned timing signal required for motor preparation in the neocortex.},

Here we present a new class of illusion in which temporal relations with spatially neighbouring objects can modulate a target object's brightness. When compared with a nearby patch of constant luminance, a brief flash appears brighter with increasing onset asynchrony. Simultaneous contrast, retinal effects, masking, apparent motion and attentional effects cannot account for this illusory enhancement of brightness.

In recent years, the cerebellum has revealed activities ranging from low frequency to very high-frequency oscillations. These rhythms depend on the brain functional state and are typical of certain circuit sections or specific neurons. Interestingly, the granular layer, which gates sensorimotor and cognitive signals to the cerebellar cortex, can also sustain low frequency (7-25 Hz) and perhaps higher-frequency oscillations. In this review we have considered (i) how these oscillations are generated in the granular layer network depending on intrinsic electroresponsiveness and circuit connections, (ii) how these oscillations are correlated with those in other cerebellar circuit sections, and (iii) how the oscillating cerebellum communicates with extracerebellar structures. It is suggested that the granular layer can generate oscillations that integrate well with those generated in the inferior olive, in deep-cerebellar nuclei and in Purkinje cells. These rhythms, in turn, might play a role in cognition and memory consolidation by interacting with the mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {In order to ameliorate the consequences of ego motion for vision, human and nonhuman observers generate reflexive, compensatory eye movements based on visual as well as vestibular information, helping to stabilize the images of visual scenes on the retina despite ego motion. And in order to fully exploit the advantages of foveal vision, they make saccades to shift the image of an object onto the fovea and smooth pursuit eye movements to stabilize it there despite continuing object movement relative to the observer. With the exception of slow visually driven eye movements, which can be understood as manifestations of relatively straightforward feedback systems, most eye movements require a direct conversion of sensory input into appropriate motor responses in the absence of immediate sensory feedback. Hence, in order to generate appropriate oculomotor responses, the parameters linking input and output must be chosen suitably. Moreover, as the parameters may change from one manifestation of a movement to the next, for instance because of oculomotor fatigue, the choices should also be quickly modifiable. This chapter will present evidence showing that this fast parametric optimization, understood as a functionally distinct example of motor learning, is an accomplishment of specific parts of the cerebellum devoted to the control of eye movements. It will also discuss recent electrophysiological results suggesting how this specific form of motor learning may emerge from information processing in cerebellar circuits. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This adaptive linear filter model of the cerebellum performs a filtering action of a phase lead-lag compensator with learning capability, and will give an account for the phenomena which have been termed "cerebellar com-pensation". It is postulated that a Golgi cell may act as a phase lag element ; for example, as a leaky integrator with time constant about several seconds. Under this assumption, a mossy fiber-granule cell-Golgi cell input network functions as a phase lead-lag com-pensator. Output signals from Golgi-granule cell systems , namely, parallel fiber signals, are gathered together through variable synaptic connections to form a Purkinje cell output. From a general theory of adap-tive linear filters, learning principles for these modifi-able connections are derived. By these learning principles , a Purkinje cell output converges to the "desired response" to minimize the mean square error of the performance. In a more general sense, a Purkinje cell acquires a filtering function on the basis of multiple pairs of input signals and corresponding desired output signals. The mode of convergence of the output signal is described when the input signal is sinusoidal.},

The parasagittal bands of decreased fluorescence are abolished by GABAA antagonists and reflect the activity of molecular layer interneurons on their targets. The same banding pattern was observed using Ca2+ imaging. The bands produce spatially specific decreases in the responses to peripheral input.

We make no effort to separate anatomical, physiological and clinical studies; rather, we hope to emphasize their interrelation. The cerebellum has always been seen as a distinct subdivision of the brain. Over the years there was an increasingly accurate description of its gross appearance and major subdivisions. By the beginning of the 19th century, the classical descriptive anatomical work was completed, and experimental study of the functions of the cerebellum began. Lesions were made in the cerebellum of experimental animals, and the behavioral deficits that were caused by the lesion were studied and described. These early animal studies powerfully influenced clinical interpretation of the symptoms seen in patients with cerebellar disease. Several questions are implicit in the anatomical and clinical studies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some of which remain incompletely answered. Many of these are addressed in other chapters in this volume. 1. Do different parts of the cerebellum do different things? The uniformity of the neuronal architecture of the cerebellar cortex suggests that each small region must operate in a similar way, but it is also clear that different regions control different functions. Is there a systematic sensory and/or body representation? 2. What are the functions of the cerebellar hemispheres? Massive in humans and very large in primates, their functions remain in dispute. Because the size of the cerebellar hemispheres parallels the development of the cerebral cortex, some have suggested that the hemispheres in humans and the higher primates may play a role in cognitive functions. 3. If one part of the cerebellum is damaged, can another part take over? A related question is whether normal motor function is possible in cases of complete or near-complete agenesis of the cerebellum. 4. What are the functions of the two distinctly different afferent systems to the cerebellum; the climbing and mossy fibers? Crown Copyright © 2009.},

   abstract = {In this report, we analyze the relationship between embodied cognition and current theories of the cerebellum, particularly the Dysmetria of Thought theory and the concept of the Universal Cerebellar Transform (UCT). First, we describe the UCT and the Dysmetria of Thought theories, highlight evidence supporting these hypotheses and discuss their mechanisms, functions and relevance. We then propose the following relationships. (i) The UCT strengthens embodied cognition because it provides an example of embodiment where the nature and intensity of the dependence between cognitive, affective and sensorimotor processes are defined. (ii) Conversely, embodied cognition bolsters the UCT theory because it contextualizes a cerebellum-focused theory within a general neurological theory. (iii) Embodied cognition supports the extension to other brain regions of the principles of organization of cerebral cortical connections that underlie the UCT: The notion that cytoarchitectonically determined transforms manifest via connectivity as sensorimotor, cognitive and affective functions resonates with the embodiment thesis that cognitive, affective and sensorimotor systems are interdependent. (iv) Embodied cognition might shape future definitions of the UCT because embodiment redefines the relationship between the neurological systems modulated by the UCT. We conclude by analyzing the relationship between our hypotheses and the concept of syntax and action semantics deficits in motor diseases.},

   abstract = {Delineation of functional topography is critical to the evolving understanding of the cerebellum's role in a wide range of nervous system functions. We used data from the Human Connectome Project (n = 787) to analyze cerebellar fMRI task activation (motor, working memory, language, social and emotion processing) and resting-state functional connectivity calculated from cerebral cortical seeds corresponding to the peak Cohen's d of each task contrast. The combination of exceptional statistical power, activation from both motor and multiple non-motor tasks in the same participants, and convergent resting-state networks in the same participants revealed novel aspects of the functional topography of the human cerebellum. Consistent with prior studies there were two distinct representations of motor activation. Newly revealed were three distinct representations each for working memory, language, social, and emotional task processing that were largely separate for these four cognitive and affective domains. In most cases, the task-based activations and the corresponding resting-network correlations were congruent in identifying the two motor representations and the three non-motor representations that were unique to working memory, language, social cognition, and emotion. The definitive localization and characterization of distinct triple representations for cognition and emotion task processing in the cerebellum opens up new basic science questions as to why there are triple representations (what different functions are enabled by the different representations?) and new clinical questions (what are the differing consequences of lesions to the different representations?).},

   abstract = {The multilayered structure of the cerebral cortex has been studied in detail. Early-born neurons migrate into the inner layer and late-born neurons migrate into more superficial layers, thus establishing an inside-out gradient. The progenitor cells appear to acquire layer-specific properties at the time of neuronal birth; however, the molecular mechanisms of cell-fate acquisition are still unclear, because it has been difficult to identify a cohort of birthdate-related progenitor cells. Using replication-defective adenoviral vectors, we successfully performed "pulse gene transfer" into progenitor cells in a neuronal birthdate-specific manner. When adenoviral vectors were injected into the midbrain ventricle of mouse embryos between embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E14.5, the adenoviral vectors introduced a foreign gene into a specific cohort of birthdate-related progenitor cells. The virally infected cohorts developed normally into cortical neurons and formed the canonical cortical layers in an inside-out manner. This technique allows us to distinguish a cohort of birthdate-related progenitor cells from other progenitor cells with different birthdates and to introduce a foreign gene into specific subsets of cortical layers by performing adenoviral injection at specific times. This adenovirus-meditated gene transfer technique will enable us to examine the properties of each subset of progenitor cells that share the same neuronal birthdate.},

   abstract = {Convergent data from various scientific approaches strongly implicate cerebellar systems in nonmotor functions. The functional anatomy of these systems has been pieced together from disparate sources, such as animal studies, lesion studies in humans, and structural and functional imaging studies in humans. To better define this distinct functional anatomy, in the current study we delineate the role of the cerebellum in several nonmotor systems simultaneously and in the same subjects using resting state functional connectivity MRI. Independent component analysis was applied to resting state data from two independent datasets to identify common cerebellar contributions to several previously identified intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) involved in executive control, episodic memory/selfreflection, salience detection, and sensorimotor function. We found distinct cerebellar contributions to each of these ICNs. The neocerebellum participates in (1) the right and left executive control networks (especially crus I and II), (2) the salience network (lobule VI), and (3) the default-mode network (lobule IX). Little to no overlap was detected between these cerebellar regions and the sensorimotor cerebellum (lobules V-VI). Clusters were also located in pontine and dentate nuclei, prominent points of convergence for cerebellar input and output, respectively. The results suggest that the most phylogenetically recent part of the cerebellum, particularly crus I and II, make contributions to parallel cortico-cerebellar loops involved in executive control, salience detection, and episodic memory/self-reflection. The largest portions of the neocerebellum take part in the executive control network implicated in higher cognitive functions such as working memory. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

   abstract = {Persistent and ramping neural activity in the frontal cortex anticipates specific movements1–6. Preparatory activity is distributed across several brain regions7,8, but it is unclear which brain areas are involved and how this activity is mediated by multi-regional interactions. The cerebellum is thought to be primarily involved in the short-timescale control of movement9–12; however, roles for this structure in cognitive processes have also been proposed13–16. In humans, cerebellar damage can cause defects in planning and working memory13. Here we show that persistent representation of information in the frontal cortex during motor planning is dependent on the cerebellum. Mice performed a sensory discrimination task in which they used short-term memory to plan a future directional movement. A transient perturbation in the medial deep cerebellar nucleus (fastigial nucleus) disrupted subsequent correct responses without hampering movement execution. Preparatory activity was observed in both the frontal cortex and the cerebellar nuclei, seconds before the onset of movement. The silencing of frontal cortex activity abolished preparatory activity in the cerebellar nuclei, and fastigial activity was necessary to maintain cortical preparatory activity. Fastigial output selectively targeted the behaviourally relevant part of the frontal cortex through the thalamus, thus closing a cortico-cerebellar loop. Our results support the view that persistent neural dynamics during motor planning is maintained by neural circuits that span multiple brain regions17, and that cerebellar computations extend beyond online motor control13–15,18.},

   abstract = {Shortly after John Eccles completed his studies of synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine, he opened another chapter of neuroscience with his work on the cerebellum. From 1963 to 1967, Eccles and his colleagues in Canberra successfully dissected the complex neuronal circuitry in the cerebellar cortex. In the 1967 monograph, "The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine", he, in collaboration with Masao Ito and Janos Szentágothai, presented blue-print-like wiring diagrams of the cerebellar neuronal circuitry. These stimulated worldwide discussions and experimentation on the potential operational mechanisms of the circuitry and spurred theoreticians to develop relevant network models of the machinelike function of the cerebellum. In following decades, the neuronal machine concept of the cerebellum was strengthened by additional knowledge of the modular organization of its structure and memory mechanism, the latter in the form of synaptic plasticity, in particular, long-term depression. Moreover, several types of motor control were established as model systems representing learning mechanisms of the cerebellum. More recently, both the quantitative preciseness of cerebellar analyses and overall knowledge about the cerebellum have advanced considerably at the cellular and molecular levels of analysis. Cerebellar circuitry now includes Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells as additional unique elements. Other new revelations include the operation of the complex glomerulus structure, intricate signal transduction for synaptic plasticity, silent synapses, irregularity of spike discharges, temporal fidelity of synaptic activation, rhythm generators, a Golgi cell clock circuit, and sensory or motor representation by mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Furthermore, it has become evident that the cerebellum has cognitive functions, and probably also emotion, as well as better-known motor and autonomic functions. Further cerebellar research is required for full understanding of the cerebellum as a broad learning machine for neural control of these functions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

How is the vector space of sensory errors encoded by this low-frequency signal? Here we measured Purkinje cell activity in the oculomotor vermis of animals during saccades, then followed the chain of events from experience of visual error, generation of CS, modulation of simple spikes, and ultimately change in motor output. We found that while error direction affected the probability of CS, error magnitude altered its temporal distribution. Production of CS changed the simple spikes on the next trial, but regardless of the actual visual error, this change biased the movement only along a vector that was parallel to the Purkinje cell's preferred error. From these results, we inferred the anatomy of a sensory-to-motor adaptive controller that transformed visual error vectors into motor-corrections.},

   abstract = {In order to control voluntary movements, the central nervous system (CNS) must solve the following three computational problems at different levels: the determination of a desired trajectory in the visual coordinates, the transformation of its coordinates to the body coordinates and the generation of motor command. Based on physiological knowledge and previous models, we propose a hierarchical neural network model which accounts for the generation of motor command. In our model the association cortex provides the motor cortex with the desired trajectory in the body coordinates, where the motor command is then calculated by means of long-loop sensory feedback. Within the spinocerebellum-magnocellular red nucleus system, an internal neural model of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system is acquired with practice, because of the heterosynaptic plasticity, while monitoring the motor command and the results of movement. Internal feedback control with this dynamical model updates the motor command by predicting a possible error of movement. Within the cerebrocerebellum-parvocellular red nucleus system, an internal neural model of the inverse-dynamics of the musculo-skeletal system is acquired while monitoring the desired trajectory and the motor command. The inverse-dynamics model substitutes for other brain regions in the complex computation of the motor command. The dynamics and the inverse-dynamics models are realized by a parallel distributed neural network, which comprises many subsystems computing various nonlinear transformations of input signals and a neuron with heterosynaptic plasticity (that is, changes of synaptic weights are assumed proportional to a product of two kinds of synaptic inputs).

   abstract = {We used transneuronal transport of neurotropic viruses to examine the topographic organization of circuits linking the cerebellar cortex with the arm area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and with area 46 in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of monkeys. Retrograde transneu-ronal transport of the CVS-11 (challenge virus strain 11) strain of rabies virus in cerebello-thalamocortical pathways revealed that the arm area of M1 receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in lobules IV-VI of the cerebellar cortex. In contrast, transneuronal transport of rabies from area 46 revealed that it receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in Crus II of the ansiform lobule. Thus, both M1 and area 46 are the targets of output from the cerebellar cortex. However, the output to each area of the cerebral cortex originates from Purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex. Anterograde transneuronal transport of the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) revealed that neurons in the arm area of M1 project via the pons to granule cells primarily in lobules IV-VI, whereas neurons in area 46 project to granule cells primarily in Crus II. Together, the findings from rabies and HSV1 experiments indicate that the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from M1 are the same as those that project to M1. Similarly, the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from area 46 are the same as those that project to area 46. Thus, our observations suggest that multiple closed-loop circuits represent a fundamental architectural feature of cerebrocerebellar interactions.},

   abstract = {Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense and less ticklish than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with fMRI to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.},

In this review, we evaluate different features of the three models based on recent computational and experimental studies.

To date, limited knowledge about the microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the major white matter tracts of the cerebellum, is available for children and adolescents. Such information would be useful as a comparison for studies of normal development, clinical conditions, or associations of cerebellar structures with cognitive and motor functions. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the variability in diffusion measures of the cerebellar peduncles within individuals and within a normative sample of healthy children. Participants were 19 healthy children and adolescents, aged 9–17 years, mean age 13.0 ± 2.3. We analyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with deterministic tractography. We generated tract profiles for each of the cerebellar peduncles by extracting four diffusion properties (fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) at 30 equidistant points along each tract. We were able to identify the middle cerebellar peduncle and the bilateral inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles in all participants. The results showed that within each of the peduncles, the diffusion properties varied along the trajectory of the tracts. However, the tracts showed consistent patterns of variation across individuals; the coefficient of variation for FA across individual profiles was low (≤20 %) for each tract. We observed no systematic variation of the diffusion properties with age. These cerebellar tract profiles of the cerebellar peduncles can serve as a reference for future studies of children across the age range and for children and adolescents with clinical conditions that affect the cerebellum.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum has too often been seen as the " little brain," subservient to the " big brain," the cerebrum. That is changing, as neuroimaging uncovers the cerebellum as the " missing link" in the neurological underpinnings of many cognitive domains. Connections between the neocortex and the cerebellum are now more precisely defined, with functionally localized areas of cerebellar cortex understood for cognitive tasks in humans. Comparative volumetric studies of the primate cerebellum have isolated some elements of circuitry, and our field is moving toward a better integration with the neurosciences in a systematic comparative framework. The next decade may show great advances, as relatively noninvasive techniques of neuroimaging have the potential to build a comparative model of the evolution of primate neurocircuitry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is said to do many things. Recording, imaging and lesion studies indicate that the cerebellum is important for coordination , balance, motor learning and even non-motor tasks 1-7. Yet its synaptic organization is remarkably uniform 8-10 , suggesting that a single characteristic computation may be accomplished in each case 4. In this sense, it may be more accurate to say that the cerebellum does one thing: it receives inputs via well-defined affer-ents and generates outputs according to its internal rules for information processing. Diversity of function then stems from differences in what inputs encode and differences in the downstream targets of cerebellar outputs. Thus, an emphasis on what the cerebellum computes may greatly facilitate our understanding of how different cerebellar regions contribute to various motor and cognitive functions. Although we lack the data required to build useful simulations of many brain systems, several factors combine to make meaningful simulations of the cerebellum feasible. These simulations help determine whether current knowledge is sufficient to explain cerebellar input/output transformations, what important information is missing, and what key experiments can discriminate between competing hypotheses. Factors that facilitate cerebellar simulations Simulating a brain system is frequently hindered by incomplete knowledge about synaptic organization and physiology, how inputs are engaged by stimuli and what they encode, and how outputs influence behavior. Owing to the efforts of Eccles, Ito, Szentagothai, Llinas and others, we largely understand the synaptic organization and physiology of the cerebellum 8-11. Similarly, analysis of cere-bellar-dependent forms of learning such as Pavlovian eyelid conditioning and adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex has revealed the types of information carried by cerebellar inputs and details of input/output transformations 12,13. Together, these advantages are fundamental to the construction and useful application of cerebel-lar simulations. The synaptic organization of the cerebellum is well known and lends itself well to simulation (Box 1) 8-10. There are an enormous number of neurons, but a limited number of neuron types. A relatively simple circuit of these neurons is repeated throughout the entire cerebellum. Inputs arrive via distinct afferents, the mossy fibers and climbing fibers, and output is provided by the cerebel-lar deep nuclei. Inputs modulate the output activity of deep nuclei cells through two pathways: direct excitatory connections from mossy fibers onto deep nuclei cells and an indirect pathway in the cerebellar cortex involving excitation of Purkinje cells by granule cells and ultimately resulting in inhibition of deep nuclei cells by Purkinje cells. The synaptic physiology, numerical ratios, convergence and divergence ratios, and geometry of projections for most of these cells are known 8-11. There is also increasingly detailed information available regarding plasticity at the granule cell to Purkinje (gr→Pkj) synapses in the cerebellar cortex and plasticity in the deep nuclei, possibly at the mossy fiber synapses onto the deep nucleus output cells (mf→nuc) 12,14-17. Together, these findings provide the information and constraints required to build computer simulations composed of detailed representations of cerebellar cells and synapses. Simulations of the cerebellum also benefit greatly from detailed information about how cerebellar inputs and outputs act under different conditions. Much of this knowledge comes from studies of eyelid conditioning, as its behavioral properties reflect relatively directly the input/output properties of the cerebellum 12,13. Eyelid conditioning involves paired presentations of a neutral stimulus such as a tone, and a reinforcing stimulus such as an air puff directed at the eye. Initially, there is only a reflex response to the air puff, but after approximately 100-200 training trials, the tone acquires the ability to elicit conditioned eyelid closure. This learning is bidi-rectional. In 'extinction' , repeated presentation of the tone without the air puff makes the conditioned response gradually disappear 18. Recording, lesion and stimulation studies show relatively direct relationships between eyelid conditioning and cerebellar inputs and outputs. The tone and air puff are conveyed to the cerebellum via mossy fibers 19-22 and climbing fibers 23-25 respectively, and output from one of the cerebellar nuclei drives the expression of learned responses 26,27 (Box 1). Although many functions have been ascribed to the cerebellum, the uniformity of its synaptic organization suggests that a single, characteristic computation may be common to all. Computer simulations are useful in examining this cerebellar computation, as they inherently address function at the level of information processing. Progress is facilitated by factors that make the cerebellum particularly amenable to such analysis. We review progress from two contrasting approaches. Top-down simulations begin with hypotheses about computational mechanisms and then ask how such mechanisms might operate within the cerebellum. Bottom-up simulations attempt to build a representation of the cerebellum that reflects known cellular and synaptic components as accurately as possible. We describe recent advances from these two approaches that are leading to an understanding of what information the cerebellum processes and how its neurons and synapses accomplish this task.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is commonly studied in the context of the classical eyeblink conditioning model, which attributes an adaptive motor function to cerebellar learning processes. This model of cerebellar function has quite a few shortcomings and may in fact be somewhat deficient in explaining the myriad functions attributed to the cerebellum, functions ranging from motor sequencing to emotion and cognition. The involvement of the cerebellum in these motor and non-motor functions has been demonstrated in both animals and humans in electrophysiological, behavioral, tracing, functional neuroimaging, and PET studies, as well as in clinical human case studies. A closer look at the cerebellum's evolutionary origin provides a clue to its underlying purpose as a tool which evolved to aid predation rather than as a tool for protection. Based upon this evidence, an alternative model of cerebellar function is proposed, one which might more comprehensively account both for the cerebellum's involvement in a myriad of motor, affective, and cognitive functions and for the relative simplicity and ubiquitous repetitiveness of its circuitry. This alternative model suggests that the cerebellum has the ability to detect coincidences of events, be they sensory, motor, affective, or cognitive in nature, and, after having learned to associate these, it can then trigger (or "mirror") these events after having temporally adjusted their onset based on positive/negative reinforcement. The model also provides for the cerebellum's direction of the proper and uninterrupted sequence of events resulting from this learning through the inhibition of efferent structures (as demonstrated in our lab). © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

   abstract = {Lixenberg A, Yarkoni M, Botschko Y, Joshua M. Encoding of eye movements explains reward-related activity in cerebellar simple spikes.The cerebellum exhibits both motor and reward-related signals. However, it remains unclear whether reward is processed independently from the motor command or might reflect the motor consequences of the reward drive. To test how reward-related signals interact with sensorimotor processing in the cerebellum, we recorded Purkinje cell simple spike activity in the cerebellar floccular complex while monkeys were engaged in smooth pursuit eye movement tasks. The color of the target signaled the size of the reward the monkeys would receive at the end of the target motion. When the tracking task presented a single target, both pursuit and neural activity were only slightly modulated by the reward size. The reward modulations in single cells were rarely large enough to be detected. These modulations were only significant in the population analysis when we averaged across many neurons. In two-target tasks where the monkey learned to select based on the size of the reward outcome, both behavior and neural activity adapted rapidly. In both the single-and two-target tasks, the size of the reward-related modulation matched the size of the effect of reward on behavior. Thus, unlike cortical activity in eye movement structures, the reward-related signals could not be dissociated from the motor command. These results suggest that reward information is integrated with the eye movement command upstream of the Purkinje cells in the floccular complex. Thus reward-related modulations of the simple spikes are akin to modulations found in motor behavior and not to the central processing of the reward value. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Disentangling sensorimotor and reward signals is only possible if these signals do not completely overlap. We recorded activity in the floccular complex of the cerebellum while monkeys performed tasks designed to separate representations of reward from those of movement. Activity modulation by reward could be accounted for by the coding of eye movement parameters, suggesting that reward information is already integrated into motor commands upstream of the floccular complex.},

   abstract = {Integration of cortical Purkinje cell inputs and brain stem inputs is essential in generating cerebellar outputs to the cerebellar nuclei (CN). Currently, collaterals of climbing and mossy fiber axons, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic axons, and collaterals of rubrospinal axons are known to innervate the CN from the brain stem. We investigated whether other afferents to the CN from the medulla exist in the rat. Retrograde labeling revealed the presence of neurons that project to the CN but not to the cerebellar cortex in the median reticular formation in the rostrodorsal medulla (tentatively named 'caudal raphe interpositus area', CRI). Anterograde tracer injection into the CRI labeled abundant axonal terminals in the CN, mainly in the ventral parvocellular part of the posterior interposed and lateral nucleus. Axonal reconstruction showed that a single CRI axon projected to the CN with 170-1086 varicosities, more broadly and densely than collaterals of a mossy or climbing fiber axon. CRI axons had no or a few collaterals that projected to the granular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellar cortex with some small terminals, indicating that these axons are different from mossy fiber axons. CRI axons also had collaterals that projected to the medial vestibular nucleus and an ascending branch that was not reconstructed. The location of the CRI, electron microscopic observations, and immunostaining results all indicated that CRI axons are not monoaminergic. We conclude that CRI axons form a type of afferent projection to the CN that is different from mossy, climbing or monoaminergic fibers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The functional domain of the cerebellum extends beyond its traditional role in motor control. In recent years, this structure has increasingly been considered to play a crucial role even in cognitive performance and attentional processes. Attention is defined as the ability to appropriately allocate processing resources to relevant stimuli. According to the Posnerian model, three interacting networks modulate attentive processes: the alerting, orienting, and executive networks. The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by the cerebellum in the functioning of the attentive networks using the Attention Network Test (ANT). We studied the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), delivered over the cerebellum in cathodal, anodal, and sham sessions, on ANT parameters in healthy subjects. After anodal and sham tDCS, the efficiency of the three attention networks remained stable, and a significant reduction in reaction time (RT) following the task repetition was observed for both congruent and incongruent targets, indicating a learning effect. After cathodal stimulation, instead, while the efficiency of the alerting and orienting networks remained stable, the efficiency of the executive network was significantly reduced. Moreover, a significant reduction in RT was observed for the congruent target alone, with no difference being detected for the incongruent target, indicating that cerebellar inhibition caused an attentive executive dysfunction specifically related to the ability to process complex stimuli in which conflict signals or errors are present. These results point to a role of the cerebellum, a subcortical structure that is thought to affect error processing both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by managing the functioning of brain cortical areas involved in the perception of conflicting signals, in the functioning of the attentional networks, particularly the executive network.},

A weight index (extrinsic fraction of labeled neurons [FLNe]) was determined for each area-to-area pathway. Newly found projections were weaker on average compared with the known projections; nevertheless, the 2 sets of pathways had extensively overlapping weight distributions. Repeat injections across individuals revealed modest FLNe variability given the range of FLNe values (standard deviation <1 log unit, range 5 log units). The connectivity profile for each area conformed to a lognormal distribution, where a majority of projections are moderate or weak in strength. In the G29 × 29 interareal subgraph, two-thirds of the connections that can exist do exist. Analysis of the smallest set of areas that collects links from all 91 nodes of the G29 × 91 subgraph (dominating set analysis) confirms the dense (66%) structure of the cortical matrix. The G29 × 29 subgraph suggests an unexpectedly high incidence of unidirectional links.

Here, we examine plasticity at a candidate site of motor learning: vestibular nerve synapses onto neurons that mediate reflexive movements. Pairing nerve activity with changes in postsynaptic voltage induced bidirectional synaptic plasticity in vestibular nucleus projection neurons: long-term potentiation relied on calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and postsynaptic hyperpolarization, whereas long-term depression relied on NMDA receptors and postsynaptic depolarization. Remarkably, both forms of plasticity uniformly scaled synaptic currents evoked by pulse trains, and these changes in synaptic efficacy were translated into linear increases or decreases in postsynaptic firing responses. Synapses onto local inhibitory neurons were also plastic but expressed only long-term depression. Bidirectional, linear gain control of vestibular nerve synapses onto projection neurons provides a plausible mechanism for motor learning underlying adaptation of vestibular reflexes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is known to project via the thalamus to multiple motor areas of the cerebral cortex. In this study, we examined the extent and anatomical organization of cerebellar input to multiple regions of prefrontal cortex. We first used conventional retrograde tracers to map the origin of thalamic projections to five prefrontal regions: medial area 9 (9m), lateral area 9 (9l), dorsal area 46 (46d), ventral area 46, and lateral area 12. Only areas 46d, 9m, and 9l received substantial input from thalamic regions included within the zone of termination of cerebellar efferents. This suggested that these cortical areas were the target of cerebellar output. We tested this possibility using retrograde transneuronal transport of the McIntyre-B strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 from areas of prefrontal cortex. Neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport of virus were found in the dentate nucleus only after injections into areas 46d, 9m, and 9l. The precise location of labeled neurons in the dentate varied with the prefrontal area injected. In addition , the dentate neurons labeled after virus injections into prefrontal areas were located in regions spatially separate from those labeled after virus injections into motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Our observations indicate that the cerebellum influences several areas of prefrontal cortex via the thalamus. Furthermore, separate output channels exist in the dentate to influence motor and cognitive operations. These results provide an anatomical substrate for the cerebellum to be involved in cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, and rule-based learning.},

   abstract = {Unipolar brush cells (UBC) are small, glutamatergic neurons residing in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex and the granule cell domain of the cochlear nuclear complex. Recent studies indicate that this neuronal class consists of three or more subsets characterized by distinct chemical phenotypes, as well as by intrinsic properties that may shape their synaptic responses and firing patterns. Yet, all UBCs have a unique morphology, as both the dendritic brush and the large endings of the axonal branches participate in the formation of glomeruli. Although UBCs and granule cells may share the same excitatory and inhibitory inputs, the two cell types are distinctively differentiated. Typically, whereas the granule cell has 4-5 dendrites that are innervated by different mossy fibers, and an axon that divides only once to form parallel fibers after ascending to the molecular layer, the UBC has but one short dendrite whose brush engages in synaptic contact with a single mossy fiber terminal, and an axon that branches locally in the granular layer; branches of UBC axons form a non-canonical, cortex-intrinsic category of mossy fibers synapsing with granule cells and other UBCs. This is thought to generate a feed-forward amplification of single mossy fiber afferent signals that would reach the overlying Purkinje cells via ascending granule cell axons and their parallel fibers. In sharp contrast to other classes of cerebellar neurons, UBCs are not distributed homogeneously across cerebellar lobules, and subsets of UBCs also show different, albeit overlapping, distributions. UBCs are conspicuously rare in the expansive lateral cerebellar areas targeted by the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway, while they are a constant component of the vermis and the flocculonodular lobe. The presence of UBCs in cerebellar regions involved in the sensorimotor processes that regulate body, head and eye position, as well as in regions of the cochlear nucleus that process sensorimotor information suggests a key role in these critical functions; it also invites further efforts to clarify the cellular biology of the UBCs and their specific functions in the neuronal microcircuits in which they are embedded. High density of UBCs in specific regions of the cerebellar cortex is a feature largely conserved across mammals and suggests an involvement of these neurons in fundamental aspects of the input/output organization as well as in clinical manifestation of focal cerebellar disease. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on evidence from neuroanatomy, physiology, neuropsychology, and computational work, sophisticated models have been developed to describe cerebellar function in sensorimotor control and learning. In contrast, mechanistic accounts of how the cerebellum contributes to cognition have remained elusive. Inspired by the homogeneous cerebellar microanatomy and a desire for parsimony, many researchers have sought to extend mechanistic ideas from motor control to cognition. One influential hypothesis centers on the idea that the cerebellum implements internal models, representations of the context-specific dynamics of an agent's interactions with the environment, enabling predictive control. We briefly review cerebellar anatomy and physiology, to review the internal model hypothesis as applied in the motor domain, before turning to extensions of these ideas in the linguistic domain, focusing on speech perception and semantic processing. While recent findings are consistent with this computational generalization, they also raise challenging questions regarding the nature of cerebellar learning, and may thus inspire revisions of our views on the role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor control.},

The borders of the cytoar-chitectonic areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2, together constituting SI, were determined cyto-and myeloarchi-tectonically. Flat maps showing the distribution of labelled cells in SI were constructed. All labelled cells were confined to lamina V, and present in deep as well as superficial parts of this lamina. The size spectrum of the corticopontine cells seemed to encompass the whole range, from the smallest to the largest seen in lamina V of SI in thionin stained sections. Average densities of labelled corticopontine cells in SI varied from 114 to 248 per mm 2 in different cases. No significant differences appear to exist between average densities in areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2. However, densities vary consistently from medial to lateral within SI. When comparing this pattern with the physiological maps showing the somatotopical organization of SI, it appears that regions representing the trunk and proximal parts of the extremities have higher densities of corticopontine neurons than regions representing distal parts of the extremities and the face. The latter parts of SI have in common a much larger magnification factor than the former, that is, the volume of cortex devoted to a certain area in the periphery is much larger in e.g. the SI face region than in the trunk region. It thus would appear that the over-representation of the face and distal extremities in terms of cortical volume devoted to them, is not upheld in terms of number of corticopontine neurons. Although apparently not paralleled in other connections of SI, the uneven densities of corticopontine projections from SI are Offprint requests to: P, Brodal (address see above) very similar to what has been described previously in the corticopontine projections from visual areas 17, 18, and 19, where regions with the largest magnification factors have the lowest densities of corticopontine neurons.

   abstract = {The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is essential for error-driven motor learning and is strongly implicated in detecting and correcting for motor errors. Therefore, elucidating how motor errors are represented in the cerebellum is essential in understanding cerebellar function, in general, and its role in motor learning, in particular. This review examines how motor errors are encoded in the cerebellar cortex in the context of a forward internal model that generates predictions about the upcoming movement and drives learning and adaptation. In this framework, sensory prediction errors, defined as the discrepancy between the predicted consequences of motor commands and the sensory feedback, are crucial for both on-line movement control and motor learning. While many studies support the dominant view that motor errors are encoded in the complex spike discharge of Purkinje cells, others have failed to relate complex spike activity with errors. Given these limitations, we review recent findings in the monkey showing that complex spike modulation is not necessarily required for motor learning or for simple spike adaptation. Also, new results demonstrate that the simple spike discharge provides continuous error signals that both lead and lag the actual movements in time, suggesting errors are encoded as both an internal prediction of motor commands and the actual sensory feedback. These dual error representations have opposing effects on simple spike discharge, consistent with the signals needed to generate sensory prediction errors used to update a forward internal model.},

In the domain of timing, prior statistics are crucial for optimal prediction, adaptation and planning. Where and how the nervous system encodes temporal statistics is, however, not known. Based on physiological and anatomical evidence for cerebellar learning, we develop a computational model that demonstrates how the cerebellum could learn prior distributions of time intervals and support Bayesian temporal estimation. The model shows that salient features observed in human Bayesian time interval estimates can be readily captured by learning in the cerebellar cortex and circuit level computations in the cerebellar deep nuclei.

   abstract = {Historically the cerebellum has been implicated in the control of movement. However, the cerebellum's role in non-motor functions, including cognitive and emotional processes, has also received increasing attention. Starting from the premise that the uniform architecture of the cerebellum underlies a common mode of information processing, this review examines recent electrophysiological findings on the motor signals encoded in the cerebellar cortex and then relates these signals to observations in the non-motor domain. Simple spike firing of individual Purkinje cells encodes performance errors, both predicting upcoming errors as well as providing feedback about those errors. Further, this dual temporal encoding of prediction and feedback involves a change in the sign of the simple spike modulation. Therefore, Purkinje cell simple spike firing both predicts and responds to feedback about a specific parameter, consistent with computing sensory prediction errors in which the predictions about the consequences of a motor command are compared with the feedback resulting from the motor command execution. These new findings are in contrast with the historical view that complex spikes encode errors. Evaluation of the kinematic coding in the simple spike discharge shows the same dual temporal encoding, suggesting this is a common mode of signal processing in the cerebellar cortex. Decoding analyses show the considerable accuracy of the predictions provided by Purkinje cells across a range of times. Further, individual Purkinje cells encode linearly and independently a multitude of signals, both kinematic and performance errors. Therefore, the cerebellar cortex's capacity to make associations across different sensory, motor and non-motor signals is large. The results from studying how Purkinje cells encode movement signals suggest that the cerebellar cortex circuitry can support associative learning, sequencing, working memory, and forward internal models in non-motor domains. © 2014 Popa, Hewitt and Ebner.},

Analysis of the computations underlying supervised learning is facilitated by the relatively simple and uniform architecture of the cerebellum, a brain area that supports numerous motor, sensory, and cognitive functions. We highlight recent discoveries indicating that the cerebellum implements supervised learning using the following organizational principles: (a) extensive preprocessing of input representations (i.e., feature engineering), (b) massively recurrent circuit architecture, (c) linear input-output computations, (d) sophisticated instructive signals that can be regulated and are predictive, (e) adaptive mechanisms of plasticity with multiple timescales, and (f) task-specific hardware specializations. The principles emerging from studies of the cerebellum have striking parallels with those in other brain areas and in artificial neural networks, as well as some notable differences, which can inform future research on supervised learning and inspire next-generation machine-based algorithms. 233},

Recently, the development and refinement of optogenetic techniques boosted research in the cerebellar field and, impressively, revolutionized the methodological approach and endowed the investigations with entirely new capabilities. This translated into a significant improvement in the data acquired for sensorimotor tests, allowing one to correlate single-cell activity with motor behavior to the extent of determining the role of single neuronal types and single connection pathways in controlling precise aspects of movement kinematics. These levels of specificity in correlating neuronal activity to behavior could not be achieved in the past, when electrical and pharmacological stimulations were the only available experimental tools. The application of optogenetics to the investigation of the cerebellar role in higher-order and cognitive functions, which involves a high degree of connectivity with multiple brain areas, has been even more significant. It is possible that, in this field, optogenetics has changed the game, and the number of investigations using optogenetics to study the cerebellar role in non-sensorimotor functions in awake animals is growing. The main issues addressed by these studies are the cerebellar role in epilepsy (through connections to the hippocampus and the temporal lobe), schizophrenia and cognition, working memory for decision making, and social behavior. It is also worth noting that optogenetics opened a new perspective for cerebellar neurostimulation in patients (e.g., for epilepsy treatment and stroke rehabilitation), promising unprecedented specificity in the targeted pathways that could be either activated or inhibited.},

We propose here that this structure is involved in maintaining a sense of direction and location during self-motion by monitoring sensory information and interacting with navigation circuits to update the mental representation of space. To better understand the processing performed by the cerebellum in the navigation function, we have reviewed: The anatomical pathways that convey self-motion information to the cerebellum; the computational algorithm(s) thought to be performed by the cerebellum from these multi-source inputs; the cerebellar outputs directed toward navigation circuits and the influence of self-motion information on space-modulated cells receiving cerebellar outputs. This review highlights that the cerebellum is adequately wired to combine the diversity of sensory signals to be monitored during self-motion and fuel the navigation circuits. The direct anatomical projections of the cerebellum toward the head-direction cell system and the parietal cortex make those structures possible relays of the cerebellum influence on the hippocampal spatial map. We describe computational models of the cerebellar function showing that the cerebellum can filter out the components of the sensory signals that are predictable, and provides a novelty output. We finally speculate that this novelty output is taken into account by the navigation structures, which implement an update over time of position and stabilize perception during navigation.},

   abstract = {Although multisensory integration has been well modeled at the behavioral level, the link between these behavioral models and the underlying neural circuits is still not clear. This gap is even greater for the problem of sensory integration during movement planning and execution. The difficulty lies in applying simple models of sensory integration to the complex computations that are required for movement control and to the large networks of brain areas that perform these computations. Here I review psychophysical, computational, and physiological work on multisensory integration during movement planning, with an emphasis on goal-directed reaching. I argue that sensory transformations must play a central role in any modeling effort. In particular, the statistical properties of these transformations factor heavily into the way in which downstream signals are combined. As a result, our models of optimal integration are only expected to apply " locally," that is, independently for each brain area. I suggest that local optimality can be reconciled with globally optimal behavior if one views the collection of parietal sensorimotor areas not as a set of task-specific domains, but rather as a palette of complex, sensorimotor representations that are flexibly combined to drive downstream activity and behavior. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In the cerebellum, it has been hypothesized that the irregularity of interspike intervals in Purkinje cells affects their ability to transmit information to downstream neurons. Accordingly, during oculomotor behavior in mice and rhesus monkeys, mean irregularity of Purkinje cell spiking varied with mean eye velocity. However, moment-to-moment variations revealed a tight correlation between eye velocity and spike rate, with no additional information conveyed by spike irregularity. Moreover, when spike rate and irregularity were independently controlled using optogenetic stimulation, the eye movements elicited were well-described by a linear population rate code with 3-5 ms temporal precision. Biophysical and random-walk models identified biologically realistic parameter ranges that determine whether spike irregularity influences responses downstream. The results demonstrate cerebellar control of movements through a remarkably rapid rate code, with no evidence for an additional contribution of spike irregularity.},

Our fMRI results show that a load increase in a nonverbal auditory working memory task is associated with enhanced brain activity in the parietal, dorsal premotor, and lateral prefrontal cortices and in lobules VII-VIII of the posterior cerebellum, whereas a sensory-motor control task activated the motor/somatosensory, medial prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices and lobules V/ VI of the anterior cerebellum. The load-dependent activity in the crus I/ II had a specific relationship with cognitive performance: This activity correlated negatively with load-dependent increase in RTs. This correlation between brain activity and RTs was not observed in the sensory-motor task in the activated cerebellar regions. Furthermore, probabilistic tractography analysis of the diffusion-weighted MRI data suggests that the tracts between the cerebral and the cerebellar areas exhibiting cognitive load-dependent and sensory-motor activity are mainly projected via separated pontine (feed-forward tracts) and thalamic (feedback tracts) nuclei. The tractography results also indicate that the crus I/II in the posterior cerebellum is linked with the lateral prefrontal areas activated by cognitive load increase, whereas the anterior cerebellar lobe is not. The current results support the view that cognitive and motor functions are segregated in the cerebellum. On the basis of these results and theories of the function of the cerebellum, we suggest that the posterior cerebellar activity during a demanding cognitive task is involved with optimization of the response speed. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The second auditory area, AII, and the adjacent auditory association areas of the STG and STP contributed modest projections to the dorsolateral, lateral, and peripedunuclar nuclei, but generally spared the extreme dorsolateral nucleus. The lower bank of the STS, which subserves central vision, the somatosensory associated region at the fundus of the rostra1 STS, and the primary auditory area did not project to the pons. The higher order, multimodal STS contribution to the corticopontocerebellar circuit may provide a partial anatomical substrate for the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to the modulation of nonmotor functions.},

   abstract = {We used tritiated amino acids to study projections to the basilar pons from prestriate cortices in 18 rhesus monkeys to determine how connectional and functional heterogeneity of these regions are reflected in corticopontine circuitry. Fibers travelled with those from other parasensory associative cortices before terminating in the pontine nuclei. Prelunate projections were derived from area 19 (OA) at the medial convexity (including areas V3 and PO) and from the lateral convexity dorsal to the caudal tip of the Sylvian fissure (including areas DP and the dorsal part of area V4d1. Pontine projections also arose from area 19 (OA), and areas TF, TL, and TH in the posterior aspect of the parahippocampal gyrus. No pontine projections arose from the prelunate convexity ventral to the caudal tip of the Sylvian fissure (ventral part of area V4d and area V ~ V) , area TEO, the inferior temporal gyrus, or the lateral ventral temporal region. Terminations in the pons were distributed in the dorsolateral and lateral nuclei, and the lateral part of the peripeduncular nucleus. Medial convexity injections produced more extensive rostrocaudal pontine labeling, as well as terminations in the extreme dorsolateral nucleus and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Dorsal prelunate injections had additional terminations in the ventral pontine nucleus. Posterior parahippocampal gyrus injections resulted in discrete label in the lateral and dorsolateral nuclei. Corticopontine projections destined for the cerebellum appear to be derived from extrastri-ate areas concerned mainly with visual spatial parameters, visual motion, and the peripheral field of vision, but not from areas subserving visual object identification and the central field of vision. Pontine afferents from the posterior parahippocampal gyrus may facilitate a cerebellar contribution to visual spatial memory, particularly when invested with motivational valence. t 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

These observations suggested to us that the functional dichotomy in the visual related areas of the temporal lobe (Teuber, '55; Trevarthen, '68; Schneider, '69; Ungerleider and Mishkin, '82; Desimone and Ungerleider, '89) are reflected in the corticopontine projection. Is there a similarly divergent pattern of corticopontine connections derived from the functionally heterogeneous visual related regions of the occipitotemporal cortices? To our knowledge there has been no comprehensive and systematic study in monkey using contemporary antero-grade techniques to evaluate the extent and organization of the corticopontine projections arising from the visual areas in the occipital and temporal cortices.

The first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors. © 2010 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

Early theories assumed that mossy fiber input is widely disseminated across the cerebellar cortex along beams of parallel fibers, which spread for several millimeters across the cerebellar cortex. Direct evidence for this has, however, proved controversial, leading to the development of an alternative hypothesis that mossy fiber inputs to the cerebral cortex are in fact vertically organized such that the ascending segment of the granule axon carries a greater synaptic weight than the parallel fiber segment. Here, we report that ascending axon synapses are selectively resistant to cerebellar long-term depression and that they release transmitter with higher mean release probabilities and mean quantal amplitudes than parallel fiber synapses. This novel specialization of synapses formed by different segments of the same axon not only explains the reported patterns of granule cell→ Purkinje cell transmission across the cerebellar cortex but also reveals an additional level of functionality and complexity of cerebellar processing. Consequently, ascending axon synapses represent a new element of cortical signal processing that should be distinguished from parallel fiber synapses in future experimental and theoretical studies of cerebellar function.

   abstract = {In our ongoing attempt to determine the anatomic substrates that could support a cerebellar contribution to cognitive processing , we investigated the prefrontal cortical projections to the basilar pons. A detailed understanding of these pathways is needed, because the prefrontal cortex is critical for a number of complex cognitive operations, and the corticopontine projection is the obligatory first step in the corticopontocerebellar circuit. Prefrontopontine connections were studied using the autoradiographic technique in rhesus monkey. The pontine projections were most prominent and occupied the greatest rostrocaudal extent of the pons when derived from the dorso-lateral prefrontal convexity, including areas 8Ad, 9/46d, and 10. Lesser pontine projections were observed from the medial prefrontal convexity and area 45B in the inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus. In contrast, ventral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices did not demonstrate pontine projections. The prefron-topontine terminations were located preferentially in the para-median nucleus and in the medial parts of the peripeduncular nucleus, but each cortical area appeared to have a unique complement of pontine nuclei with which it is connected. The existence of these corticopontine pathways from prefrontal areas concerned with multiple domains of higher-order processing is consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is an essential node in the distributed corticosubcortical neural circuits subserving cognitive operations. The corticopontine projection is the obligatory first step in the feedforward limb of the cerebrocerebellar circuit. Several investigators have described pontine projections from cerebral association areas (Nyby and Jansen, 1951; Brodal, 1978; Wiesendanger et al., 1979; Glickstein et al., 1985; May and Andersen, 1986; Fries, 1990).

We suggest that the two cortices co-operate by generating precise temporal patterns in the cerebral cortex that are detected in the cerebellar cortex as temporal patterns assembled spatially in the mossy fibers. We will begin by showing that the tidal-wave mechanism works in the cerebellar cortex as a read-out mechanism for such spatio-temporal patterns due to the synchronous activity they generate in the parallel fiber system which drives the Purkinje cells - the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex - to fire action potentials. We will review the anatomy of the mossy fibers and show that within a "beam", or "row" of cerebellar cortex the mossy fibers in principle could embed a vast number of tidal-wave generating sequences. Based on anatomical data we will argue that the cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell-Purkinje cell system can potentially detect and - through learning - select from an enormous number of spatio-temporal patterns. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Does the cerebellum influence nonmotor behavior? Recent anatomical studies demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum targets multiple nonmotor areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex, as well as the cortical motor areas. The projections to different cortical areas originate from distinct output channels within the cerebellar nuclei. The cerebral cortical area that is the main target of each output channel is a major source of input to the channel. Thus, a closed-loop circuit represents the major architectural unit of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. The outputs of these loops provide the cerebellum with the anatomical substrate to influence the control of movement and cognition. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data supply compelling support for this view. The range of tasks associated with cerebellar activation is remarkable and includes tasks designed to assess attention, executive control, language, working memory, learning, pain, emotion, and addiction. These data, along with the revelations about cerebro-cerebellar circuitry, provide a new framework for exploring the contribution of the cerebellum to diverse aspects of behavior.

While several lines of evidence have suggested that the CNS predicts motion states and signals from motor commands for control and perception (forward dynamics), it remains controversial whether it also performs the ‘inverse’ computation, i.e. the estimation of force from motion (inverse dynamics). Here, we show that the resistive sensation we experience while moving a delayed cursor, perceived purely from the change in visual motion, provides evidence of the inverse computation. To clearly specify the computational process underlying the sensation, we systematically varied the visual feedback and examined its effect on the strength of the sensation. In contrast to the prevailing theory that sensory prediction errors modulate our perception, the sensation did not correlate with errors in cursor motion due to the delay. Instead, it correlated with the amount of exposure to the forward acceleration of the cursor. This indicates that the delayed cursor is interpreted as a mechanical load, and the sensation represents its visually implied reaction force. Namely, the CNS automatically computes inverse dynamics, using visually detected motions, to monitor the dynamic forces involved in our actions.},

In contrast, we report that synaptic plasticity can itself be precisely tuned to the requirements of a learning task. We found that the rules for induction of long-term and single-trial plasticity at parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses vary across cerebellar regions. In the flocculus, associative plasticity in vitro and in vivo is narrowly tuned for an interval of ∼120 ms, which compensates for the specific processing delay for error signals to reach the flocculus during oculomotor learning. In the vermis, which supports a range of behavioral functions, plasticity is induced by a range of intervals, with individual cells tuned for different intervals. Thus, plasticity at a single, anatomically defined type of synapse can have properties that vary in a way that is precisely matched to function.},

The cerebro-cerebellum, the phylogenetically newest expansion in the cerebellum, receives convergent inputs from cortical, subcortical, and spinal sources, and is thought to perform the predictive computation for both motor control, motor learning, and cognitive functions. This predictive computation is known as an internal forward model. First, we elucidate the theoretical foundations of an internal forward model and its role in motor control and motor learning within the framework of the optimal feedback control model. Then, we discuss a neural mechanism that generates various patterns of outputs from the cerebro-cerebellum. Three lines of supporting evidence for the internal-forward-model hypothesis are presented in detail. First, we provide physiological evidence that the cerebellar outputs (activities of dentate nucleus cells) are predictive for the cerebellar inputs [activities of mossy fibers (MFs)]. Second, we provide behavioral evidence that a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motion in control subjects but lags behind a target motion in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Third, we provide morphological evidence that the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus receive separate MF projections, a prerequisite for optimal estimation. Finally, we speculate that the predictive computation in the cerebro-cerebellum could be deployed to not only motor control but also to non-motor, cognitive functions. This review concludes that the predictive computation of the internal forward model is the unifying algorithmic principle for understanding diverse functions played by the cerebro-cerebellum.},

Its white matter consists of axons that enter the pons via the cerebral peduncle, and of the axons derived from the pontine nerve cells themselves. Of the former group, cortico-spinal and some cortico-bulbar fibers just traverse this region, the balance consisting of cortico-pontine fibers that relay at the pontine nerve cells. Although no quantitative information about the pontine complex is available, there are numerous published estimates of the number of axons that traverse the pons to congregate in the pyramid. These estimates center around a mean of 1 million axons for one side. The counting of axons in a section at the level of the pyramid is facilitated by the predominantly parallel course of the constituent fibers. Within the cerebral peduncle, however, fiber bundles that meander are frequently encountered. This pattern requires specialized statistical treatment when fiber densities are sampled over the cross-section of the cerebral peduncle. Owing to their wavy course, a considerable proportion of fiber groups is cut at oblique angles.

   abstract = {The cerebellum is an essential part of the neural network involved in adapting goal-directed arm movements. This adaptation might rely on two distinct signals: a sensory prediction error or a motor correction. Sensory prediction errors occur when an initial motor command is generated but the predicted sensory consequences do not match the observed values. In some tasks, these sensory errors are monitored and result in on-line corrective motor output as the movement progresses. Here we asked whether cerebellum-dependent adaptation of reaching relies on sensory or on-line motor corrections. Healthy controls and people with hereditary cerebellar ataxia reached during a visuomotor perturbation in two conditions: "shooting" movements without on-line corrections and "pointing" movements that allowed for on-line corrections. Sensory (i.e., visual) errors were available in both conditions. Results showed that the addition of motor corrections did not influence adaptation in control subjects, suggesting that only sensory errors were needed for learning. Cerebellar subjects were comparably impaired in both adaptation conditions relative to controls, despite abnormal and inconsistent on-line motor correction. Specifically, poor on-line motor corrections were unrelated to cerebellar subjects' adaptation deficit (i.e., adaptation did not worsen), further suggesting that only sensory prediction errors influence this process. Therefore adaptation to visuomotor perturbations depends on the cerebellum and is driven by the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory outcome of motor commands.

   abstract = {The capacity to understand another person's emotions, intentions, beliefs and personality traits, based on observed or communicated behaviors, is termed social cognition. During the last decade, social neuroscience has made great progress in understanding the neural correlates of social cognition. However, because the cerebellum is traditionally viewed as only involved in motor processing, the contribution of this major part of the brain in social processing has been largely ignored and its specific role in social cognition remains unclear. Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses have made its crucial contribution to social cognition evident. This raises the question: What is the exact function of the cerebellum in social cognition? We hypothesize that the cerebellum builds internal action models of our social inter-actions to predict how other people's actions will be executed, what our most likely responses are to these actions, so that we can automatize our interactions and instantly detect disruptions in these action sequences. This mechanism likely allows to better anticipate action sequences during social interactions in an automatic and intuitive way and to fine-tune these anticipations, making it easier to understand behaviors and to detect violations. This hypothesis has major implications in neurological disorders affecting the cerebellum such as autism, with detrimental effects on social functionality, especially on more complex and abstract social cognitive processes. Because the fundamental anatomical organization of the cerebellum is identical in many species (cerebellar microcomplexes), this hypothesis could have major impacts to elucidate social interactions in social animals.},

   abstract = {Cerebellar zones were there, of course, before anyone noticed them. Their history is that of young people, unhindered by preconceived ideas, who followed up their observations with available or new techniques. In the 1960s of the last century, the circumstances were fortunate because three groups, in Leiden, Lund, and Bristol, using different approaches, stumbled on the same zonal pattern in the cerebellum of the cat. In Leiden, the Häggqvist myelin stain divulged the compartments in the cerebellar white matter that channel the afferent and efferent connections of the zones. In Lund, the spino-olivocerebellar pathways activated from individual spinal funiculi revealed the zonal pattern. In Bristol, charting the axon reflex of olivocerebellar climbing fibers on the surface of the cerebellum resulted in a very similar zonal map. The history of the zones is one of accidents and purposeful pursuit. The technicians, librarians, animal caretakers, students, secretaries, and medical illustrators who made it possible remain unnamed, but their contributions certainly should be acknowledged. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

Unilateral FB injections in the cervical cord and the pyramidal tract respectively produced soft blue fluorescent labelling of pyramidal fibres and of fibres and structures resembling 'terminals' in the pontine grey: contralateral to the spinal injections and ipsilateral to the pyramidal injections. These labelled elements were concluded to represent collaterals of corticospinal and pyramidal fibres because (a) their distribution corresponded to that of the pericruciate cortico-pontine fibres, (b) their labelling was prevented when the FB injections were preceded by a transection of either the cerebral peduncle or the pyramidal tract which lesions also prevented the FB labelling of the distal parts of the transected axons. Similar findings were obtained when using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. In other experiments FB-labelling of pyramidal collaterals was combined with retrograde labelling of pontine neurones projecting to the contralateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum using diamidino yellow dihydrochloride as the second tracer. The distributions of the retrogradely labelled neurones and of the pyramidal collaterals in the pontine grey showed an almost complete overlap indicating that these collaterals mainly establish connections with the cerebellar anterior lobe.},

The visual and eye movement related responses of 73 neurons encountered in the more caudal part of the dlpn were analyzed. Thirty eight of these could be assigned to one of the three following groups. Visual-only neurons (Type 1, n = 10) responded to movement of a broad range of visual stimuli in certain preferred directions. Their receptive fields were usually large, not restricted to the contralateral visual field and always included the fovea. Visual-tracking (VT) neurons (n-28) discharged in relation to smooth pursuit of a small target in particular preferred directions. Nine of these (Type 2) did not respond to visual stimulation during stationary fixation. Nineteen VT-cells (Type 3) discharged in relation to both visual tracking and visual stimulation. In 9 of the Type 3 neurons, the preferred directions for visual stimulation and tracking were opposite, whereas they were the same in the other 10. Visual responses of Type 3 neurons were indistinguishable from those of Type 1 neurons. Testing of an additional 9 neurons driven by either visual-tracking or pattern movement was not sufficient to allow a definite assignment to one of the groups 1, 2 or 3. The distribution of preferred directions for both visual stimulation and visual tracking was widely scattered between 0 and 360 deg. Our results suggest that the dlpn is a constituent in a cerebro-cerebellar loop important for the generation of smooth pursuit eye movements.},

We review findings that demonstrate widespread reward-related cognitive input to the cerebellum, as well as new studies that have characterized the codependence of processing in the neocortex and cerebellum.

Here, we elaborate the cell-type specificity of a broad connectivity matrix from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) to the dorsal striatum in mice. Cerebello-striatal connections arise from all deep cerebellar subnuclei and are relayed through intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN). In the dorsal striatum, these connections target medium spiny neurons, but also ChAT-positive interneurons, a class of tonically active interneurons implicated in shifting and updating behavioral strategies. Chemogenetic silencing of cerebello-striatal connectivity modifies function of striatal ChAT-positive interneurons.

   abstract = {The cerebellum plays a critical role in coordinating and learning complex movements. Although its importance has been well recognized, the mechanisms of learning remain hotly debated. According to the classical cerebellar learning theory, depression of parallel fiber synapses instructed by error signals from climbing fibers, drives cerebellar learning. The uniqueness of long-term depression (LTD) in cerebellar learning has been challenged by evidence showing multi-site synaptic plasticity. In Purkinje cells, long-term potentiation (LTP) of parallel fiber synapses is now well established and it can be achieved with or without climbing fiber signals, making the role of climbing fiber input more puzzling. The central question is how individual Purkinje cells extract global errors based on climbing fiber input. Previous data seemed to demonstrate that climbing fibers are inefficient instructors, because they were thought to carry “binary” error signals to individual Purkinje cells, which significantly constrains the efficiency of cerebellar learning in several regards. In recent years, new evidence has challenged the traditional view of “binary” climbing fiber responses, suggesting that climbing fibers can provide graded information to efficiently instruct individual Purkinje cells to learn. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical progress regarding modulated climbing fiber responses in Purkinje cells. Analog error signals are generated by the interaction of varying climbing fibers inputs with simultaneous other synaptic input and with firing states of targeted Purkinje cells. Accordingly, the calcium signals which trigger synaptic plasticity can be graded in both amplitude and spatial range to affect the learning rate and even learning direction. We briefly discuss how these new findings complement the learning theory and help to further our understanding of how the cerebellum works.},

   abstract = {The human brain contains approximately 60 billion cerebellar granule cells, which outnumber all other brain neurons combined. Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-Anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.},

   abstract = {More than a century after the description of its cardinal components, the cerebellar motor syndrome (CMS) remains a cornerstone of daily clinical ataxiology, in both children and adults. Anatomically, motor cerebellum involves lobules I–V, VI, and VIII. CMS is typically associated with errors in the metrics of voluntary movements and a lack of coordination. Symptoms and motor signs consist of speech deficits, impairments of limb movements, and abnormalities of posture/gait. Ataxic dysarthria has a typical scanning (explosive with staccato) feature, voice has a nasal character, and speech is slurred. Cerebellar mutism is most common in children and occurs after resection of a large midline cerebellar tumor. Ataxia of limbs includes at various degrees dysmetria (hypermetria: overshoot, hypometria: undershoot), dysdiadochokinesia, cerebellar tremor (action tremor, postural tremor, kinetic tremor, some forms of orthostatic tremor), isometrataxia, disorders of muscle tone (both hypotonia and cerebellar fits), and impaired check and rebound. Handwriting is irregular and some patients exhibit megalographia. Cerebellar patients show an increased body sway with a broad-based stance (ataxia of stance). Gait is irregular and staggering. Delayed learning of complex motor skills may be a prominent feature in children. CMS is currently explained by the inability of the cerebellum to handle feedback signals during slow movements and to create, store, select, and update internal models during fast movements. The cerebellum is embedded in large-scale brain networks and is essential to perform accurate motor predictions related to body dynamics and environmental stimuli. Overall, the observations in children and adults exhibiting a CMS fit with the hypothesis that the cerebellum contains neural representations reproducing the dynamic properties of body, and generates and calibrates sensorimotor predictions. Therapies aiming at a reinforcement or restoration of internal models should be implemented to cancel CMS in cerebellar ataxias. The developmental trajectory of the cerebellum, the immature motor behavior in children, and the networks implicated in CMS need to be taken into account.},

These conditions comprise the most common mental disorder group. There are a high proportion of patients who fail to achieve remission and the presence of high relapse rates indicate the therapeutic options available are far from being fully efficient. Despite an increased understanding the neural circuits underlying fear and anxiety-related behaviors in the last decades, a factor that could be partially contributing to the lack of adequate therapies may be an insufficient understanding of the core features of the disorders and their associated neurobiology. Interestingly, the cerebellum shows connections with fear and anxiety-related brain areas and functional involvement in such processes, but explanations for its role in anxiety disorders are lacking. Therefore, the aims of this review are to provide an overview of the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety and its connections to the cerebellum, and of the animal studies that directly assess an involvement of the cerebellum in these processes. Then, the studies performed in patients suffering from anxiety disorders that explore the cerebellum will be discussed. Finally, we'll propose a function for the cerebellum in these disorders, which could guide future experimental approaches to the topic and lead to a better understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety-related disorders, ultimately helping to develop more effective treatments for these conditions.},

   abstract = {Beyond the classic clinical description, recent studies have quantitatively evaluated gait and balance dysfunction in cerebellar ataxias by means of modern motion analysis systems. These systems have the aim of clearly and quantitatively describing the differences, with respect to healthy subjects, in kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyography variables, establishing the basis for a rehabilitation strategy and assessing its efficacy. The main findings which characterize the gait pattern of cerebellar patients are: increased step width, reduced ankle joint range of motion with increased coactivation of the antagonist muscles, and increased stride-to-stride variability. Whereas the former is a compensatory strategy adopted by patients to keep the center of mass within the base of support, the latter indicates the inability of patients to maintain dynamic balance through a regular walking pattern and may reflect the primary deficit directly related to cerebellar dysfunction and the consequent lack of muscle coordination during walking. Moreover, during the course of the disease, with the progressive loss of walking autonomy, step length, and lower-limb joint range of motion are drastically reduced. As to the joint coordination defect, abnormal intralimb joint coordination during walking, in terms of both joint kinematics and interaction torques, has been reported in several studies. Furthermore, patients with cerebellar ataxia show a poor intersegmental coordination, with a chaotic coordinative behavior between trunk and hip, leading to increased upper-body oscillations that affect gait performance and stability, sustaining a vicious circle that transforms the upper body into a generator of perturbations. The use of motion analysis laboratories allows a deeper segmental and global characterization of walking impairment in these patients and can shed light on the nature of both the primary specific gait disorder and compensatory mechanisms. Such deeper understanding might reasonably represent a valid prerequisite for establishing better-targeted rehabilitation strategies.},

Both processes can be readily followed at the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse in the cerebellum. Shortly after birth, around five equally strong climbing fiber synapses are established. Subsequently, one of these five synaptic connections starts to grow in size and synaptic strength, while the others degenerate and eventually disappear. Both the elimination of the redundant climbing fiber synapses and the strengthening of the surviving one depend on a combination of a genetically coded blueprint and synaptic activity. Recently, it has been shown that synaptic activity affects the synaptic strength of developing climbing fibers. Remarkably, the same pattern of paired activity of the presynaptic climbing fiber and the postsynaptic Purkinje cell resulted in strengthening of already "large" climbing fibers and weakening of already "weak" climbing fibers. In this review, we will integrate the current knowledge of synaptic plasticity of climbing fibers with that of other processes affecting climbing fiber development. © 2009 IBRO.},

Since motor imagery and execution of movement share common pathways, and the cerebellum has an inhibitory effect on the motor cortex, we speculated that the cerebellum also has an inhibitory role on MI. Methods: To test this hypothesis, 12 healthy individuals aged 27-47 years (mean age 33.3 years) were enrolled in the study. Subjects were asked to imagine two different tasks, one complex (MI-c) and one simple (MI-s) motor task. The intensity of anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) was set at 2 mA for 20 min. Sham ctDCS consisted of 30 s current stimulation. Results: MI-s resulted in significantly increased log MEP amplitude during MI, compared with control MEP amplitude,(p = 0.000). The increase in log MEP amplitude during MI disappeared after anodal ctDCS. Before sham ctDCS, both MI-s and MI-c resulted in log MEP amplitude increases (p = 0.000). This facilitator effect of both MI-c and MI-s on log MEP amplitude was also persistent after sham ctDCS (p = 0.000). Conclusions: The study demonstrates for the first time that the cerebellum has an inhibitory effect on MI. Significance: Combining ctDCS with MI significantly modulates corticomotor excitability.},

   abstract = {Classical conditioning of the eye-blink reflex in the rabbit is a form of motor learning that is uniquely dependent on the cerebellum. The cerebellar learning hypothesis proposes that plasticity subserving eye-blink conditioning occurs in the cerebellum. The major evidence for this hypothesis originated from studies based on a telecommunications network metaphor of eye-blink circuits. These experiments inactivated parts of cerebellum-related networks during the acquisition and expression of classically conditioned eye blinks in order to determine sites at which the plasticity occurred. However, recent evidence revealed that these manipulations could be explained by a network performance hypothesis which attributes learning deficits to a non-specific tonic dysfunction of eye-blink networks. Since eye-blink conditioning is mediated by a spontaneously active, recurrent neuronal network with strong tonic interactions, differentiating between the cerebellar learning hypothesis and the network performance hypothesis represents a major experimental challenge. A possible solution to this problem is offered by several promising new approaches that minimize the effects of experimental interventions on spontaneous neuronal activity. Results from these studies indicate that plastic changes underlying eye-blink conditioning are distributed across several cerebellar and extra-cerebellar regions. Specific input interactions that induce these plastic changes as well as their cellular mechanisms remain unresolved. © 2009 IBRO.},

Mossy fibers form excitatory inputs on to the paint brush shaped dendrioles in the form of giant, glutamatergic synapses, activation of which results in prolonged bursts of action potentials in the postsynaptic UBC. The axons of UBCs themselves form mossy fiber contacts with other UBCs and granule cells, forming an excitatory, intrinsic cerebellar network that has the capacity to synchronize and amplify mossy fiber inputs to potentially large populations of granule cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that UBCs in rat cerebellar slices express low voltage activated (LVA) fast-inactivating and high voltage activated (HVA) slowly inactivating calcium channels. LVA calcium currents are mediated by T-type calcium channels and they are associated with calcium increases in the dendrites and to a lesser extent the cell soma. HVA currents, mediated by L-type calcium channels, are slowly inactivating and they produce larger overall increases in intracellular calcium but with a similar distribution pattern. We review these observations alongside several recent papers that examine how intrinsic membrane properties influence UBCs firing patterns and we discuss how UBC signaling may affect downstream cerebellar processing. © 2009 IBRO.},

This TARP family of molecules controls both trafficking and functional properties of AMPARs at most, if not all, excitatory central synapses. Furthermore, individual TARPs differ in their effects on the biophysical and pharmacological properties of AMPARs. The critical importance of TARPs in synaptic transmission was first revealed in experiments on cerebellar granule cells from stargazer mice. These lack the prototypic TARP stargazin, present in granule cells from wild-type animals, and consequently lack synaptic transmission at the mossy fibre-to-granule cell synapse. Subsequent work has identified many other members of the stargazin family which act as functional TARPs. It has also provided valuable information about specific TARPs present in many central neurons. Because much of the initial work on TARPs was carried out on stargazer granule cells, the important functional properties of TARPs present throughout the cerebellum have received particular attention. Here we discuss some of these recent findings in relation to the main TARPs and the AMPAR subunits identified in cerebellar neurons and glia. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites are made by a proximal dendritic domain, which is provided with scattered clusters of spines innervated by a single climbing fiber (CF) and by a distal domain with a high density of spines innervated by parallel fibers (PFs). Following block of electrical activity a spine increase occurs in the proximal domain and the new spines are innervated by the PFs while the number of synaptic contacts formed by the CF is reduced. Also the GABAergic input expands its territory of innervation on the proximal domain, which undergoes a profound restructuring of the glutamate and GABA receptors. Excitatory-like postsynaptic assemblies appear not only on the new spines, but also on the smooth region of the dendrite and both of them may be innervated by GABAergic terminals. In this case GABA receptors coexist with the glutamate receptors leading to the formation of hybrid synapses. In contrast, PF synapses contain solely glutamate receptors. Thus, the expression of glutamate receptors appears to be an intrinsic property of the PC, while the expression of the GABA receptors is induced by the presence of GABAergic terminals. The data highlight an important feature of the CF input; its electrical activity, in addition to inducing a powerful phasic excitation and a tonic inhibition, controls the finer architecture of the cerebellar cortex. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The brain generates many rhythmic activities, and the olivo-cerebellar system is not an exception. In recent years, the cerebellum has revealed activities ranging from low frequency to very high-frequency oscillations. These rhythms depend on the brain functional state and are typical of certain circuit sections or specific neurons. Interestingly, the granular layer, which gates sensorimotor and cognitive signals to the cerebellar cortex, can also sustain low frequency (7-25 Hz) and perhaps higher-frequency oscillations. In this review we have considered (i) how these oscillations are generated in the granular layer network depending on intrinsic electroresponsiveness and circuit connections, (ii) how these oscillations are correlated with those in other cerebellar circuit sections, and (iii) how the oscillating cerebellum communicates with extracerebellar structures. It is suggested that the granular layer can generate oscillations that integrate well with those generated in the inferior olive, in deep-cerebellar nuclei and in Purkinje cells. These rhythms, in turn, might play a role in cognition and memory consolidation by interacting with the mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Grip force modulation has a rich history of research, but the results remain to be integrated as a neurocomputational model and applied in a robotic system. Adaptive grip force control as exhibited by humans would enable robots to handle objects with sufficient yet minimal force, thus minimizing the risk of crushing objects or inadvertently dropping them. We investigated the feasibility of grip force control by means of a biological neural approach to ascertain the possibilities for future application in robotics. As the cerebellum appears crucial for adequate grip force control, we tested a computational model of the olivo-cerebellar system. This model takes into account that the processing of sensory signals introduces a 100 ms delay, and because of this delay, the system needs to learn anticipatory rather than feedback control. For training, we considered three scenarios for feedback information: (1) grip force error estimation, (2) sensory input on deformation of the fingertips, and (3) as a control, noise. The system was trained on a data set consisting of force and acceleration recordings from human test subjects. Our results show that the cerebellar model is capable of learning and performing anticipatory grip force control closely resembling that of human test subjects despite the delay. The system performs best if the delayed feedback signal carries an error estimation, but it can also perform well when sensory data are used instead. Thus, these tests indicate that a cerebellar neural network can indeed serve well in anticipatory grip force control not only in a biological but also in an artificial system. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is a central brain structure deeply integrated into major loops with the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. The cerebellum shows a complex regional organization consisting of modules with sagittal orientation. The cerebellum takes part in motor control and its lesions cause a movement incoordination syndrome called ataxia. Recent observations also imply involvement of the cerebellum in cognition and executive control, with an impact on pathologies like dyslexia and autism. The cerebellum operates as a forward controller learning to predict the precise timing of correlated events. The physiologic mechanisms of cerebellar functioning are still the object of intense research. The signals entering the cerebellum through the mossy fibers are processed in the granular layer and transmitted to Purkinje cells, while a collateral pathway activates the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Purkinje cells in turn inhibit DCN, so that the cerebellar cortex operates as a side loop controlling the DCN. Learning is now known to occur through synaptic plasticity at multiple synapses in the granular layer, molecular layer, and DCN, extending the original concept of the Motor Learning Theory that predicted a single form of plasticity at the synapse between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells under the supervision of climbing fibers deriving from the inferior olive. Coordination derives from the precise regulation of timing and gain in the different cerebellar modules. The investigation of cerebellar dynamics using advanced physiologic recordings and computational models is now providing new clues on how the cerebellar network performs its internal computations.},

The regular spiking patterns were discovered in extracellular recordings of simple spikes in awake and anesthetized rodents, where it was shown that more than half of the spontaneous activity consists of short epochs of regular spiking. These periods of regular spiking are interrupted by pauses, which can be tightly synchronized among nearby Purkinje cells, while the spikes in the regular patterns are not. Interestingly, pauses are affected by long-term depression of the parallel fiber synapses. Both in modeling and slice experiments it was demonstrated that long-term depression causes a decrease in the duration of pauses, leading to an increase of the spike output of the neuron. Based on these results we propose that pauses in the simple spike train form a temporal code which can lead to a rebound burst in the target deep cerebellar nucleus neurons. Conversely, the regular spike patterns may be a rate code, which presets the amplitude of future rebound bursts. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Whereas the cerebellum contains 22 different types of neuropeptides as presently known, their expression is generally weak and diffusely dispersed in cerebellar tissues, which often makes their functional significance doubtful. Nevertheless, our knowledge about certain neuropeptides has advanced to the extent that we can figure out their unique functional roles in cerebellar circuits. Throughout the cerebellum, CRF is contained in climbing fibers and its spontaneous release is required for the induction of cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), a cellular mechanism of motor learning. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is also expressed in the paraventricular nucleus-pituitary system and amygdala-lower brainstem system, both of which are involved in coping responses to stress. In view that motor learning requires stressful efforts for correcting errors in repeated trials, CRF in climbing fibers may imply that the olivocerebellar system is part of a large CRF-operated functional system that acts to cope with various stressors. Orexin, on the other hand, is contained in beaded fibers, which, originating from the hypothalamus, project to various brainstem nuclei and also to the cerebellum, exclusively the flocculus. Currently available evidence suggests that, in fight-or-flight situations, orexinergic neurons switch the state of cardiovascular control systems including the flocculus to secure blood supply to working muscles. Considerable knowledge has also been accumulated about angiotensin II, galanin, and cerebellin, but there is still a gap in defining their unique functional roles in cerebellar circuits. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapse in the cerebellum provides an ideal model for the study of developmental rearrangements of neural circuits. At birth, each PC is innervated by multiple CFs. These surplus CFs are eliminated during postnatal development, and mono innervation is attained by postnatal day 20 (P20) in mice. Earlier studies on spontaneous mutant mice and animals with "hypogranular" cerebella indicate that regression of surplus CFs requires normal generation of granule cells and their axons, parallel fibers (PFs), and normal formation of PF-PC synapses. Our understanding of how PF-PC synapse formation affects development of CF-PC synapse has been greatly advanced by analyses of mutant mice deficient in glutamate receptor δ2 subunit (GluRδ2), an orphan receptor expressed selectively in PCs. Deletion of GluRδ2 results in impairment of PF-PC synapse formation, which leads to defects in development of CF-PC synapses. In this article, we review how impaired PF-PC synapse formation affects wiring of CFs to PCs based mostly on our data on GluRδ2 knockout mice. We propose a new scheme that CF-PC synapses are shaped by the three consecutive events, namely functional differentiation of multiple CFs into one strong and a few weak inputs from P3 to P7, "early phase" of CF synapse elimination from P7 to around P11, and "late phase" of CF synapse elimination from around P12. Normal PF-PC synapse formation is required for the "late phase" of CF synapse elimination. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Internal models are a key feature of most modern theories of motor control. Yet, it has been challenging to localize internal models in the brain, or to demonstrate that they are more than a metaphor. In the present review, I consider a large body of data on the cerebellar floccular complex, asking whether floccular output has features that would be expected of the output from internal models. I argue that the simple spike firing rates of a single group of floccular Purkinje cells could reflect the output of three different internal models. (1) An eye velocity positive feedback pathway through the floccular complex provides neural inertia for smooth pursuit eye movements, and appears to operate as a model of the inertia of real-world objects. (2) The floccular complex processes and combines input signals so that the dynamics of its average simple spike output are appropriate for the dynamics of the downstream brainstem circuits and eyeball. If we consider the brainstem circuits and eyeball as a more broadly conceived "oculomotor plant," then the output from the floccular complex could be the manifestation of an inverse model of "plant" dynamics. (3) Floccular output reflects an internal model of the physics of the orbit where head and eye motion sum to produce gaze motion. The effects of learning on floccular output suggest that it is modeling the interaction of the visually-guided and vestibular-driven components of eye and gaze motion. Perhaps the insights from studying oculomotor control provide groundwork to guide the analysis of internal models for a wide variety of cerebellar behaviors. © 2009 IBRO.},

In this circuitry, Golgi interneurons suppress granule cell excitability via the inhibitory GABA transmitter. A novel technique termed reversible neurotransmission blocking (RNB) was genetically established, in which granule cell transmission to Purkinje cells was selectively and reversibly blocked in the mouse cerebellar circuitry. This study revealed that Purkinje cells are essential for expression of conditioned eye-blink motor learning but that this memory is acquired and stored in deep cerebellar nuclei. A different technique termed immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting (IMCT) was developed to selectively ablate Golgi cells from the mouse cerebellar network. The study disclosed that excitatory glutamate receptors and inhibitory GABA receptors cooperatively act at Golgi cell-mossy fiber-granule cell synapses and are indispensable for motor coordination and adaptation. Finally, gene targeting of mGluR2 displayed that the metabotropic glutamate receptor acts collaboratively with the ionotropic AMPA receptors at granule cell-Golgi cell synapses and is crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation in the mouse cerebellar circuitry. The neural information is thus hierarchically regulated and integrated at different levels of the cerebellar network. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum can be viewed as supporting two distinct aspects of motor execution related to a) motor coordination and the sequence that imparts such movement temporal coherence and b) the reorganization of ongoing movement when a motor execution error occurs. The former has been referred to as "motor time binding" as it requires that the large numbers of motoneurons involved be precisely activated from a temporal perspective. By contrast, motor error correction requires the abrupt reorganization of ongoing motor sequences, on occasion sufficiently important to rescue the animal or person from potentially lethal situations. The olivo-cerebellar system plays an important role in both categories of motor control. In particular, the morphology and electrophysiology of inferior olivary neurons have been selected by evolution to execute a rather unique oscillatory pace-making function, one required for temporal sequencing and a unique oscillatory phase resetting dynamic for error correction. Thus, inferior olivary (IO) neurons are electrically coupled through gap junctions, generating synchronous subthreshold oscillations of their membrane potential at a frequency of 1-10 Hz and are capable of fast and reliable phase resetting.

Lesions of the cerebellar vermis may affect fear memory without altering baseline motor/autonomic responses to the frightening stimuli. Reversible inactivation of the vermis during the consolidation period impairs retention of fear memory. In patients with medial cerebellar lesions conditioned bradycardia is impaired. In humans, cerebellar areas around the vermis are activated during mental recall of emotional personal episodes, if a loved partner receives a pain stimulus, and during learning of a CS-US association. Moreover, patients with cerebellar stroke may fail to show overt emotional changes. In such patients, however, the activity of several areas, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, pulvinar and insular cortex, is significantly increased relative to healthy subjects when exposed to frightening stimuli. Therefore, other structures may serve to maintain fear response after cerebellar damage. These data indicate that the vermis is involved in the formation of fear memory traces. We suggest that the vermis is not only involved in regulating the autonomic/motor responses, but that it also participates in forming new CS-US associations thus eliciting appropriate responses to new stimuli or situations. In other words, the cerebellum may translate an emotional state elaborated elsewhere into autonomic and motor responses. © 2009 IBRO.},

We evaluated motor deficits in patients following cerebellar stroke using a modified version of the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (MICARS). Lesion location was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized axial tomography (CT). Patients were grouped by stroke location-Group I, stroke within the anterior lobe (lobules I-V); Group 2, anterior lobe and lobule VI; Group 3, posterior lobe (lobules VI-IX; including flocculonodular lobe, lobule X); Group 4, posterior lobe but excluding lobule VI (i.e. lobules VII-X); Group 5, stroke within anterior lobe plus posterior lobe. Results. Thirty-nine patients were examined 8.0±6.0 days following stroke. There were no Group 1 patients. As mean MICARS scores for Groups 2 through 5 differed significantly (one-way analysis of variance, F(3,35)=10.9, P=0.000 03), post hoc Tukey's least significant difference tests were used to compare individual groups. Group 2 MICARS scores (n=6; mean±SD, 20.2±6.9) differed from Group 3 (n=6; 7.2±3.8; P=0.01) and Group 4 (n=13; 2.5±2.0; P=0.000 02); Group 5 (n=14; 18.6±12.8) also differed from Group 3 (P=0.009) and Group 4 (P=0.000 02). There were no differences between Groups 2 and 5 (P=0.71), or between Group 3 and Group 4 (P=0.273). However, Group 3 differed from Group 4 when analyzed with a two-sample t-test unadjusted for multiple comparisons (P=0.03). Thus, the cerebellar motor syndrome resulted from stroke in the anterior lobe, but not from stroke in lobules VII-X (Groups 2 plus 5, n=20, MICARS 19.1±11.2, vs. Group 4; P=0.000 002). Strokes involving lobule VI produced minimal motor impairment. Conclusion.

We report emerging structure–function relationships with specific symptoms: cerebellar regions that interconnect with sensorimotor cortices are associated with motor impairments when damaged; disruption to posterolateral cerebellar regions that form circuits with association cortices impact long-term cognitive outcomes; and midline posterior vermal damage is associated with behavioral dysregulation and an autism-like phenotype. We also explore the impact of age and the potential role for critical periods on cerebellar structure and child function. These findings suggest that the cerebellum plays a critical role in motor, cognitive, and social–behavioral development, possibly via modulatory effects on the developing cerebral cortex.},

   abstract = {Anatomical, clinical and imaging findings suggest that the cerebellum is engaged in cognitive and affective functions as well as motor control. Evidence from converging modalities also indicates that there is a functional topography in the human cerebellum for overt control of movement vs. higher functions, such that the cerebellum can be divided into zones depending on connectivity with sensorimotor vs. multimodal association cortices. Using functional MRI, we show that regions active during overt movement differ from those involved in higher-level language, spatial processing and working memory tasks. Nine healthy participants each completed five tasks in order to determine the relative activation patterns for the different paradigms. Right-handed finger-tapping activated right cerebellar lobules IV-V and VIII, consistent with descriptions of the cerebellar homunculi. Verb generation engaged right cerebellar lobules VI-Crus I and a second cluster in lobules VIIB-VIIIA. Mental rotation activation peaks were localized to medial left cerebellar lobule VII (Crus II). A 2-back working memory task activated bilateral regions of lobules VI-VII. Viewing arousing vs. neutral images did not reliably activate the cerebellum or cerebral limbic areas in this study. The cerebellar functional topography identified in this study reflects the involvement of different cerebro-cerebellar circuits depending on the demands of the task being performed: overt movement activated sensorimotor cortices along with contralateral cerebellar lobules IV-V and VIII, whereas more cognitively demanding tasks engaged prefrontal and parietal cortices along with cerebellar lobules VI and VII. These findings provide further support for a cerebellar role in both motor and cognitive tasks, and better establish the existence of functional subregions in the cerebellum. Future studies are needed to determine the exact contribution of the cerebellum - and different cerebro-cerebellar circuits - to task performance. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The peculiar shape and disposition of Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites, planar and highly branched, offers an optimal model to analyze cellular and molecular regulators for the acquisition of neuronal dendritic trees. During the first 2 weeks after the end of the proliferation period, PCs undergo a 2-phase remodeling process of their dendrites. The first phase consists in the complete retraction of the primitive but extensive dendritic tree, together with the formation of multiple filopodia-like processes arising from the cell body. In the second phase, there is a progressive disappearance of the somatic processes along with rapid growth and branching of the mature dendrite. Mature Purkinje cell dendrites bear two types of spiny protrusions, named spine and thorn. The spines are numerous, elongated, located at the distal dendritic compartment and form synapses with parallel fibers, whereas the thorns are shorter, rounded, emerge from the proximal compartment and synapse with climbing fibers. Different culture models and mutant mice analyses suggest the identification of intrinsic versus extrinsic determinants of the Purkinje cell dendritic development. The early phase of dendritic remodeling might be cell autonomous and regulated by specific transcription factors such as retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα). Afferent fibers, trophic factors and hormones regulate the orientation and growth of the mature dendritic tree contributing, with still unknown intrinsic factors, to sculpt its general architecture. The formation of spines appears as an intrinsic phenomenon independent of their presynaptic partner, the parallel fibers, and confined to the distal compartment by inhibitory influences of the climbing fibers along the proximal compartment. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Classic central synaptic transmission by fast neurotransmitters-glutamate, GABA or glycine-involves liberation from vesicles directly opposite postsynaptic receptors at junctions containing both a presynaptic active zone and a postsynaptic specialisation. Such classic transmission is thought to underlie much of the information transfer and processing in the brain. However, there also exist a substantial number of reports of signalling by the same transmitters outside this classic framework, whereby liberation and/or receptor activation occur beyond synaptic boundaries. We term these processes collectively parasynaptic signalling. Here, we describe the various forms of parasynaptic signalling and the available methods for distinguishing them from synaptic transmission. We then review the numerous reports of parasynaptic signalling in the cerebellar cortex, a structure whose specialised anatomy and synapses have facilitated studies of these mechanisms. We examine more generally the question of how the multiple signalling pathways might avoid interaction and address the possible functions of parasynaptic transmission, which in the cerebellar cortex include the regulation of network activity, glial tropism and the control of synaptic plasticity. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) with different radiotracers enable regional evaluation of blood flow and glucose metabolism, of receptors and transporters of several molecules, and of abnormal deposition of peptides and proteins in the brain. The cerebellum has been used as a reference region for different radiotracers in several disease conditions. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis is not affected by a priori knowledge bias and should be preferred. SPECT and PET have contributed to establishing the cerebellum role in motion, cognition, and emotion control in physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. The basic abnormal imaging findings include decreased or increased uptake of flow or metabolism tracers in the cerebellum alone or as part of a network. Decreased uptake is generally observed in primary structural damage of the cerebellum, but can also represent a distant effect of cerebral damage (crossed diaschisis). Increased uptake can be observed in Freidreich ataxia, inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases of the cerebellum, and in status epilepticus. The possibility is also recognized that primary structural damage of the cerebellum might determine distance effects on other brain structures (reversed diaschisis). So far, SPECT and PET have been predominantly used in clinical studies to investigate cerebellar changes in neurologic and psychiatric diseases and in connection with pharmacologic, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep-brain stimulation, or surgical treatments.},

   abstract = {While high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with newer analysis methods has become a powerful tool in human cerebral lesion studies, comparatively few studies have used these advanced imaging techniques to study lesions of the human cerebellum and their associated symptoms. This review will summarize the methodology of MRI-based lesion-symptom mapping of the human cerebellum and discuss its potential for gaining insights into cerebellar function. The investigation of patients with defined focal lesions yields the greatest potential for obtaining meaningful correlations between lesion site and behavioral deficits. In smaller groups of patients overlay plots and subtraction analysis are good options. If larger groups of patients are available, different statistical techniques have been introduced to compare behavior and lesion site on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Although localization in degenerative cerebellar disorders is less accurate because of the diffuse nature of the disease, certain information about the supposed function of larger subdivisions of the cerebellum can be gained. Examples are given which show that lesion-symptom mapping allows to investigate the function of the intermediate zone and cerebellar nuclei. We conclude that meaningful correlations between lesion site and behavioral data can be obtained in patients with degenerative as well as focal cerebellar disorders. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum and its associated circuitry constitutes the entire essential neuronal system for classical conditioning of eye-blink and other discrete responses (e.g. limb flexion) learned with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) using the standard delay paradigm where the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US coterminate. Evidence reviewed here strongly supports the following conclusions. The CS pathway involves sensory relay nuclei projections to the pontine nuclei and its mossy fiber projections to the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. The US pathway involves activation of the inferior olive (dorsal accessory olive for eye blink) and its climbing fiber projections to the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. The conditioned response (CR) pathway involves the cerebellar interpositus nucleus, the superior cerebellar peduncle pathway to the magnocellular red nucleus and rubral projections to premotor and motor nuclei generating the behavioral response. Anatomical data, neuronal unit recordings, electrical stimulation, lesions and methods of reversible inactivation all strongly support the hypothesis that the essential memory trace for the learning of these discrete conditioned responses is formed and stored in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus. Neuronal/synaptic plasticity is also established in the cerebellar cortex in this form of learning but the role of the cortex is less clear. We argue that the cortex plays a key role in normal acquisition and adaptive timing of the conditioned response, under certain circumstances, but it remains unclear exactly what features of conditioning are being encoded in the cerebellar cortex in this basic form of associative learning and memory. © 2009 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The cerebro-cerebellar system is one of the largest pathways in the central nervous system, yet knowledge of its structure and function remains far from complete. This is an important gap in understanding because anatomical connectivity is a key determinant of cerebellar function. This updated chapter focuses on recent advances in understanding the anatomical and physiological properties of cerebro-cerebellar connections in nonhuman species. There are two main routes by which cerebral information can gain access to the cerebellum: cerebro-pontocerebellar pathways that terminate in the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers and cerebro-olivocerebellar pathways that terminate as climbing fibers. A common principle of organization seems to be the convergence of somatotopically corresponding pathways, with the climbing fiber system playing a key role in imposing this order. In addition to this well-ordered spatial arrangement, there is also precise timing of integration of ascending and descending inputs. The spatial and temporal congruence of inputs is consistent with the one-map hypothesis of cerebellar organization (Apps and Hawkes, Nat Rev Neurosci 10:670-681, 2009). The functional significance of this precise arrangement remains to be determined but is likely to have a major impact on cerebellar activity.},

   abstract = {The input to the cerebellum has long been known to originate from widespread regions of the cerebral cortex including the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. The output of the cerebellum, however, was thought to project mainly to the primary motor cortex. Recent anatomical observations have challenged this view. It is now apparent that cerebellar output goes to multiple cortical areas, including not only the primary motor cortex but also areas of premotor and prefrontal cortex. In fact, there is growing evidence that each of the areas of cerebral cortex that project to the cerebellum is also the target of cerebellar output. The cerebellar output to individual cortical areas originates from distinct clusters of neurons in the deep nuclei which we have termed 'output channels'. The individual output channels to the cortical areas we have examined display little or no overlap. Physiological recordings in awake trained primates indicate that neurons in different output channels appear to be involved in distinct aspects of behavior, and in both motor and cognitive functions. These observations indicate that the cerebellar influence on the cerebral cortex is more extensive than previously recognized.},

   abstract = {The cerebellum is a softball-sized structure located at the base of the skull. Grab the back of your head just above where it meets your neck: your hand is now cupped around your cerebellum. As with most brain systems, much of what we know about the cerebellum stems from symptoms of damage or pathology and from its connectivity with the rest of the brain. From such evidence it has long been clear that the cerebellum is an important component of the motor system. Severe abnormalities of movement are produced by pathologies of the cerebellum. Cerebellar output influences systems that are nambiguously motor, and inputs to the cerebellum convey information known to be essential for movement such as joint angles and loads on muscles. Recently it has become equally clear that the role of the cerebellum is not limited to movement. This is indicated by its interconnections with nonmotor structures; by the more subtle, nonmotor deficits seen with cerebellar lesions; and by functional imaging studies where regions of the cerebellum show activation during nonmotor tasks. A deeper understanding of the cerebellum will require dentification of the common aspects or computational demands that these motor and nonmotor functions share. },
