Figure 2 in Loebner 1989 (see :ref:`about`) is one of the main starting points for this
website.  How would that figure be updated to given
more recent data?  Some papers that may provide updates:

* Summary of four updates: Purkinje cells inhibit other Purkinje cells
  :cite:`WitterL+4-2016`, molecular layer interneurons inhibit other
  molecular layer interneurons in a way that is spatially highly
  structured :cite:`RieublandS+2-2014`, :cite:`ArltC+HausserM-2020`,
 and Golgi cells inhibit other Golgi cells :cite:`HullC+RegehrWG-2012`. At the
  same time, previously hypothesized connections between molecular
  layer interneurons and Golgi cells have been ruled out4 :cite:`HullC+RegehrWG-2012`.

* Purkinje Cell Collaterals Feed Back to Purkinje Cells and Interneurons. 
  :cite:`WitterL+4-2016`  :footcite:`WitterL+4-2016`.
