Figure 2 in Loebner 1989 (see :ref:`about`) is one of the main starting points for this
website.  How would that figure be updated to given
more recent data?  Some papers that may provide updates:

* Paper :cite:`DeZeeuwCI+2-2021` gives a summary of multiple updates. From text:  
  The discovery of several new connections (Fig. 1, red) highlights a
  previously unappreciated level of recurrence in the cerebellar circuit.
  Mutual inhibition of like cell types is common: Purkinje cells inhibit
  other Purkinje cells :footcite:`WitterL+4-2016`, molecular layer interneurons inhibit other
  molecular layer interneurons in a way that is spatially highly structured
  :footcite:`RieublandS+2-2014`, :footcite:`ArltC+HausserM-2020`,
  and Golgi cells inhibit other Golgi cells :footcite:`HullC+RegehrWG-2012`. At the same time,
  previously hypothesized connections between molecular layer interneurons
  and Golgi cells have been ruled out :footcite:`HullC+RegehrWG-2012`. There also is electrical
  coupling among molecular layer interneurons5 and among Golgi cells :footcite:`DugueGP-2009+8`.
  Circuitry in the granule cell layer has the potential to filter and even
  reverse the sign of the input from mossy fibers, especially if it incorporates
  the unipolar brush cells7. In some regions, collaterals from
  Purkinje cells contact (inhibit) granule cells and create an additional recurrent
  connection in the input layer :footcite:`GuoC+5-2016`. Finally, neurons in the cerebellar nuclei
  provide feedback to the cerebellar cortex, via a mossy fiber-like projection
  that is subject to plastic changes during learning9,10.
  

* Inhibitory neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the
  cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar
  Golgi cells. :cite:`AnkriL+5-2015`, :footcite:`AnkriL+5-2015`.
