Overview
========

Adapted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell:

   Purkinje cells are some of the largest neurons in the human brain
   with an intricately elaborate dendritic
   arbor, characterized by a large number of dendritic spines. Purkinje
   cells are found within the Purkinje layer in the cerebellum. Purkinje
   cells are aligned like dominos stacked one in front of the
   other. Their large dendritic arbors form nearly two-dimensional layers
   through which parallel fibers from the deeper-layers pass. These
   parallel fibers make relatively weaker excitatory (glutamatergic)
   synapses to spines in the Purkinje cell dendrite, whereas climbing
   fibers originating from the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla
   provide very powerful excitatory input to the proximal dendrites and
   cell soma. Parallel fibers pass orthogonally through the Purkinje
   neuron's dendritic arbor, with up to 200,000 parallel fibers
   forming a Granule-cell-Purkinje-cell synapse with a single Purkinje
   cell. Each Purkinje cell receives approximately 500 climbing fiber
   synapses, all originating from a single climbing fiber.  Both basket
   and stellate cells (found in the cerebellar molecular layer) provide
   inhibitory (GABAergic) input to the Purkinje cell, with basket cells
   synapsing on the Purkinje cell axon initial segment and stellate cells
   onto the dendrites.
   
   Purkinje cells send inhibitory projections to the deep cerebellar
   nuclei, and constitute the sole output of all motor coordination in
   the cerebellar cortex.   

   See :ref:`microcircuit` for a diagram of Purkinje cells.

Quantity
========

Cat:
   The total number of Purkinje ceils was 1.2-1.3 million. :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971a`.

   The granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio was 1700-1800.  :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` p. 29.


Human:
   15 million (total number both hemispheres) :cite:`TomaschJ-1968`.


See Table 2 in note for :cite:`LangeW-1975` for granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio for different species.

Connection to Purkinje Cells
============================


Purkinje cells have inhibitory synaptic connections to other Purkinje cells through axon collaterals
:cite:`WitterL+4-2016`.


Structure
---------

In mice:

   Collaterals were confined to a narrow
   sagittal plane but extended hundreds of micrometers within
   that plane.  :cite:`WitterL+4-2016`

Divergence and convergence
--------------------------

In mice:

   5 to 10  :cite:`WitterL+4-2016`


Connection to Granule cells
===========================

:cite:`GuoC+5-2016` shows that Purkinje cells directly inhibit granule
cells.  "... non-canonical feedback is region specific: it is most
prominent in lobules that regulate eye movement and process vestibular
information"


Divergence and convergence
--------------------------

Unknown


Connection to DCN
=================


Divergence
----------

In cat:

   35 "one Purkinje axon may
   reach potentially 35 nuclear cells." :cite:`PalkovitsM+3-1977`.
   Also, :cite:`PalkovitsM+3-1977` Fig 2 (probably from the same source).


Convergence
-----------

In cat:

   Around 860 "the probable convergence of Purkinje axons
   upon nuclear cells can be deduced as being numerically somewhere around
   860"  :cite:`PalkovitsM+3-1977`.

   700 :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` Fig 2.
