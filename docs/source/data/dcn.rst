Deep Cerebellar Nuclei
**********************

Overview
========

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_cerebellar_nuclei:

   The cerebellum has four deep cerebellar nuclei embedded in the white
   matter in its center.  These nuclei receive inhibitory (GABAergic)
   inputs from Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and excitatory
   (glutamatergic) inputs from mossy fiber and climbing fiber
   pathways. Most output fibers of the cerebellum originate from these
   nuclei. One exception is that fibers from the flocculonodular lobe
   synapse directly on vestibular nuclei without first passing through
   the deep cerebellar nuclei. The vestibular nuclei in the brainstem are
   analogous structures to the deep nuclei, since they receive both mossy
   fiber and Purkinje cell inputs.  From lateral to medial, the four deep
   cerebellar nuclei are the dentate, emboliform, globose, and
   fastigii. Some animals, including humans, do not have distinct
   emboliform and globose nuclei, instead having a single, fused
   interposed nucleus. In animals with distinct emboliform and globose
   nuclei, the term interposed nucleus is often used to refer
   collectively to these two nuclei.


Quantity

Cat:

   The total number of the cerebellar nuclear cells was found to be
   4.6x10^4.  On the basis of karyometric studies the medial and
   interpositus nuclei appear to contain two, the lateral nucleus
   probably three different neuron populations. The over-all numerical
   ratio between Purkinje and nuclear cells is 26:1.

Excitatory connection to Granule and Golgi Cells
================================================

   From :cite:`AnkriL+5-2015`:

   A less-known nucleo-cortical circuit is formed by the glutamatergic neurons of the CN which, in
   addition to projecting to various premotor and associative regions of the brain ...
   send axonal collaterals to the cerebellar granule cell layer (GrCL; Houck and Person, 2015).
   These collateral fibers form MF-like terminals contacting granule cell (GrC) and Golgi cell dendrites
   ... . The functional
   significance of this excitatory nucleo-cortical (eNC) pathway, loosely following the modular
   arrangement of the cerebellum ... is likely related to efference copying of motor commands to
   the cerebellar cortex (Sommer and Wurtz, 2008; Houck and Person, 2015).


Inhibitory connection to Golgi Cells
====================================


   Some Golgi cells receive inhibition from deep Cerebellar Nuclei :cite:`AnkriL+5-2015`.  From abstract:
   (data from mice):

   The cerebellum, a crucial center for motor coordination, is composed of a cortex and
   several nuclei. The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by
   the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing
   that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the
   cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar
   Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the
   inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may
   contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition
   onto granule cells.


Inhibitory connection to Inferior Olive
=======================================

   From :cite:`AnkriL+5-2015`:

   Currently, the cerebellar cortex and the CN are known to interact through two circuits. The best
   known is the nucleo-olivary (NO) circuit (...) where the small GABAergic CN cells, subject to PN
   inhibition (Najac and Raman, 2015), project to the contralateral IO (Fredette and Mugnaini, 1991).
   This pathway regulates olivary activity (...) and thereby complex spike activity in the PNs and
   cerebellar cortical plasticity (...).
