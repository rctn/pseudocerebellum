Glomeruli

Overview
========

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus_(cerebellum):

   The cerebellar glomerulus is a small, intertwined mass of nerve fiber
   terminals in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. It consists
   of post-synaptic granule cell dendrites and pre-synaptic Golgi cell
   axon terminals surrounding the pre-synaptic terminals of mossy
   fibers. (from: http://neurolex.org/wiki/Category:Cerebellar_glomerulus)


Density
=======

In cat:

   In 1 cu.mm of the granular layer 98,800 glomeruli are found on average.

   "With direct counting of the glomeruli
   the corrected density was found to be 98,879 +/- 4,065/cu.mm; ..."
   :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 23.


Quantity
========

In cat:

   The granule cell-glomerulus ratio is 27-28:1.  :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`
   The density of granule cells was found earlier 1Â° to be 2,800,000/cu.mm 
   (for the living), hence the glomerulus-granule cell
   ratio is 1:28.32.   :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 23.

   "According to earlier data :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` the granule cell-glomerulus ratio is
   27-28:1, the mossy fiber-granule cell ratio is therefore 1:460."
   :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 28.

   The granular layer contributed to 29.09% of the total cerebellar
   volume, their absolute number being *2.2 x 10^9*. :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` p. 29.

Connection to grannule cells
============================

Divergence
----------

Cat:

   From :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 26:
   "Four mossy fibers entering a folium give rise to 16 rosettes
   each, hence a total of 64 glomeruli. Since *one glomerulus has synaptic contacts with
   an average of 28 granule cells*, the total number of granule cells reached by the 4 mossy
   fibers will be 1,792. Each granule cell is presumed to pick up excitatory impulses from
   4 glomeruli belonging to different mossy fibers by as many dendrites."

   but also, from the same paper, page 28:
   "The granule cells have
   4.17 dendrites, on average; *the average mossy rosette is contacted by 112 granule
   dendrites*. The number of postsynaptic units (dendrite digits) is 10.2/dendrite and
   1,142/glomerulus."

   This seems contradictory, (28 granule cells vs 112 granule dendrites).  I think the
   "dendrite digits" refers to a dendrite having multiple protrusions as shown in
   :cite:`EcclesJC+2-1967` Fig. 75 (see note for this paper), so those can be ignored
   for the purpose of calculating the divergence.

   So, the question is whether the divergence from glomeruli is 28 or 112?  I think it is
   112, and that the value of 28 is calculated by taking into account the convergence of 4
   (112 / 4) = 28.  This seems compatable with the divergence:convergence from mossy fibers
   to granule cells given in the :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` fig 2 which is 1.7x10^3:4 because 1,792
   is given as the number of granule cells reached by 4 mossy fibers on average (quote above
   from :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 26) and Loebner is
   using that as the number reached by one mossy fiber, which means that mossy fiber has 4x
   the divergence than that given by one mossy fiber.

   Another potential contradiction is the total number of mossy fibers.
   In the Loebner paper,
   the divergence:convergence from mossy fibers to granule cells is given as 1.7x10^3:4 and
   the number of granule cells is given as 2.2 x 10^9.  From this, the number of mossy fibers
   would be about (2.2x10^9 * 4 / 1.7x10^3) = 5.2x10^6 mossy fibers.  This is more than the estimated
   number of 2.4 x 10^6 mossy fibers, which might already be an overestimate.

Rat:
   From :cite:`JakabRL+HamoriJ-1988`, abstract
   The results demonstrate that, in the rat cerebellum, there
   is a high degree of convergence of granule cells at a glomerulus
   (53 to 1); and that there is a rich inhibitory input
   to about 60% of all granule cell dendrites.

Convergence
-----------
   
   In our Golgi-Kopsch stained material the number of dendrites ranged from 2 to
   7. 61.6% of cells had 4 dendrites, 22.4% had 5 dendrites and 15.2% had 3 dendrites.
   *The average dendrite number was calculated as 4.17.*  :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972` p. 24.
