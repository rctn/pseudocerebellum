Overview
========

   (adapted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_granule_cell):

   Cerebellar granule cells form the thick granular layer of the
   cerebellar cortex and are among the smallest neurons in the
   brain. (The term granule cell is used for several unrelated types of
   small neurons in various parts of the brain.) Cerebellar granule cells
   are also the most numerous neurons in the brain: in humans, estimates
   of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that they
   constitute about 3/4 of the brain's neurons.
      
   The cell bodies are packed into a thick granular layer
   at the bottom of the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four
   to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a
   dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input
   from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.
   
   The thin, unmyelinated axons of granule cells rise vertically to the
   upper (molecular) layer of the cortex, where they split in two, with
   each branch traveling horizontally to form a parallel fiber; the
   splitting of the vertical branch into two horizontal branches gives
   rise to a distinctive "T" shape. In humans, a parallel fiber runs for
   an average of 3 mm in each direction from the split, for a total length of about
   6 mm (about 1/10 of the total width of the cortical layer).  As they
   run along, the parallel fibers pass through the dendritic trees of
   Purkinje cells, contacting one of every 3–5 that they pass, making a
   total of 80–100 synaptic connections with Purkinje cell dendritic
   spines.[1] Granule cells use glutamate as their neurotransmitter, and
   therefore exert excitatory effects on their targets.
      
See :ref:`microcircuit` for a diagram of grannule cells.


Density
=======

In cat:

   A percentage of 41.85% of the total volume of the granular substance was
   occupied by the granule cells (bodies), their density calculated for the living state
   being 2.8 x 10^6/cu.mm.  :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` p. 29.
   

In rat:

   Using morphological measurements, it can be calculated that the rat
   cerebellar granular layer has a cell density of 4 × 10^6/mm^3 for
   granule cells and 9300/mm^3 for Golgi cells, with a Golgi cell :
   granule cell ratio of 1:430 (Korbo et al., 1993).  Moreover, the
   density of the glomeruli is 3 × 10^5/mm^3, and each glomerulus is
   composed of one mossy fiber terminal, about 53 dendrites from separate
   granule cells (Jakaband Hamori, 1988), and one or more dendrites from
   Golgi cells.  :cite:`DAngeloE+5-2013` p. 9-10.
   

Quantity
========

In cat:


   The granular layer contributed to 29.09% of the total cerebellar
   volume, their absolute number being *2.2 x 10^9*. :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` p. 29.

   This value is used in :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` (the value is probably from the same
   source, e.g. :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b`).


   The granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio was 1700-1800.  :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` p. 29.

See Table 2 in note for :cite:`LangeW-1975` for granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio for different species.


Connection to Purkinje Cells
============================

Structure
---------

In cat:

   From: :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`:

   Numerically, the granule cells belonging to one Purkinje cell
   (1,792) are capable of transmitting impulses from 4 mossy fibers and their 68 rosettes
   (glomeruli), while the parallel fibers, being 2 mm long, penetrate the dendrite trees of
   225 Purkinje cells. Since they establish synapses with only every fifth of these Purkinje
   cells, the calculated number of parallel fibers-Purkinje spine synapses would be 80,550/
   Purkinje cell 11. This calculated value agrees reasonably well with the counted number
   of Purkinje cell dendritic spines = 91,600.

   Each granule call split to form a "T" to form parallel fibers that extend 1 mm (2 mm total)
   in a direction parallel to the longititudional access of the folium (that is in a direction
   perpendicular to the Purkinje cells).

Divergence
----------

Cat: 45.

   From: :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`, p. 27: The parallel fibers divide in
   T-fashion and run in both directions for an average distance of 1 mm, i.e. they are
   2 mm long n. They establish synapses with only about every fifth Purkinje cell whose
   dendritic tree they cross. With 225 Purkinje cell dendritic trees accommodated in
   2 mm along the longitudinal axis of the folium 9, *each parallel fiber may contact
   synaptically 45* Purkinje cells.

   This is different from the value given in Fig. 2 of :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989`, which is
   200 * 10^3.  I'm not sure what that figure is referring to.

Convergence
-----------

Cat: 80,550

   From: :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1972`
   Since they establish synapses with only every fifth of these Purkinje
   cells, the calculated number of parallel fibers-Purkinje spine synapses would be 80,550/
   Purkinje cell :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971c`. This calculated value agrees reasonably well
   with the counted number of Purkinje cell dendritic spines = 91,600.
   
   This is similar to the value in :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` Fig. 2 (8.5 x 10^4).  I'm not sure
   what the source is of that value.
