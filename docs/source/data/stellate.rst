**Overview**
   (adapted from: http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cerebellum#Neuronal_types):

   
   Basket and Stellate cells: Are interneurons present in the molecular
   layer. They are both inhibitory (GABAergic) on to
   Purkinje cells. Their axons run in the same direction as the dendrites
   of the Purkinje cells are electrically coupled and
   receive both climbing fiber collaterals as well as parallel fibers
   originating in the granule layer.

Gap junctions and synapses between stellate cells
=================================================

From: :cite:`RieublandS+2-2014`

   By recording from multiple molecular
   layer interneurons in the cerebellar cortex, we
   reveal specific, nonrandom connectivity patterns in
   both GABAergic chemical and electrical interneuron
   networks. 
   
   Chemical connections exhibit a preference for transitive patterns,
   such as feedforward triplet motifs. This structured connectivity is
   supported by a characteristic spatial organization: transitivity of
   chemical connectivity is directed vertically in the sagittal plane,
   and electrical synapses appear strictly confined to the sagittal
   plane.
