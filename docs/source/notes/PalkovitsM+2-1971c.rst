The granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio was 1700-1800 : 1.

The previous paper in the series :cite:`PalkovitsM+2-1971b` states that
there are about 1.25 x 10^6 purkinje cells.  This paper estimates that the
Purkinje cell-basket cell ratio is 1 : 6; the Purkinje cell-stellate cell
ratio 1 : 16-17.5.  Based on that, there would be about
7.5x10^6 basket cells and 20.9x10^6 stellate cells.

Summary section of paper:

   Cell density in the molecular layer of the cat cerebellar cortex calculated for the
   living state is 43,700/cu.mm. Of these 15% are basket cells, 42.8% stellate cells and
   41.2% are glial elements (including endothelial cells, pericytes, etc.). The Purkinje
   cell-basket cell ratio is 1 : 6; the Purkinje cell-stellate cell ratio 1 : 16-17.5. Of the
   basket cells 21% are located in the ganglionic layer and 79.9% in the molecular layer.
   Of the molecular layer basket cells 95% are situated in the deeper half of this stratum.
   The average length of the basket axons in the transverse plane of the folium is 500-550
   um (a distance of 10 Purkinje cells). The average span of their descending side branches
   in the longitudinal plane of the folium is 300-320 um (a distance of 3-3 Purkinje
   cell bodies in both directions). Calculations of the average number of Purkinje cell
   baskets in which the basket axon participates gave unexpectedly low values: 8-9
   baskets per axon.
   
   Statistical evaluation of systematic measurements performed on electron micrographs
   of the molecular layer yielded the following quantitative data for the parallel
   fibers: the average length of the parallel fibers is 2 mm, their average diameter 0.197
   um and in a 1 mm wide longitudinal prism of the molecular layer in the living animal
   there are 1,374,000 parallel fibers. The average diameter of parallel fibers is slightly
   greater in the deeper palt of the molecular layer; the difference, although statistically
   significant, is hardly relevant biologically. The average number of parallel fibers
   crossing the whole dendritic arborization of a Purkinje cell is roughly 400,000.
   Calculation based on the average lengths and densities of parallel fiber synaptic
   thickenings showed that the parallel fiber makes synaptic contact with, on an average,
   only every fifth (allowing for correction, every 5.5th) Purkinje dendrite arborization
   which it penetrates during its course. The average parallel fiber would thus contact, in
   its entire course of 2 mm, 45 Purkinje cells (after correction, 42.5). The number of
   dendritic spines per Purkinje cells is calculated to be 80,000.
