This paper has lots of data about number of efferent and afferent fibers cell counts in human cerebellum.

cortico-pontine (From cerebral cortex to pons).
   19.14 million axons (for one side).

ponto-cerebellar (from pons to cerebellum).
   Total of 23.085 million nerve cells within the pontine grey. May range from 17 to 25 million neurons.

Ratio of ponto-cerebellar to cortico-pontine
   From 1:1.37 to 1:2.25.  "This overall convergence ratio may not be uniform for every individual circuit,
   it indicates a definite reduction, however, in the number of unit-elements involved from the peduncular
   to the pontine level."
