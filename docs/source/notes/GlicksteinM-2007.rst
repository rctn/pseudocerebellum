States that:

   The cerebellum is probably
   the single most important link
   between visual and motor
   areas of the cerebral cortex.
   What sort of visual information
   reaches the cerebellum? In
   monkeys there are two groups
   of cortical areas that process
   visual information beyond the
   primary visual cortex. A dorsal,
   medially located group that
   is dominated by cells that are
   responsive primarily to moving
   stimuli, and a ventral group
   involved in visual recognition.
   Ungerleider and Mishkin [14]
   based their suggested grouping
   of visual areas — “where is it?”
   versus “what is it?” — on the
   behavioural effects of lesions.
   Jack May and I [15] based our
   distinction between a medial and
   a lateral group on the difference
   in the pontine projections of the
   two groups. The dorsal group
   is connected to the cerebellum
   by way of the pons; the lateral,
   more ventrally placed group is
   not. Information on movement
   of objects and of the body in
   relation to its surroundings
   is sent continuously to the
   cerebellum by cells in the dorsal
   cortical visual areas. Lesions of
   the dorsal group, including the
   cortex within the angular gyrus
   in monkeys [16] and a similar
   cortical area in humans [17]
   produce a lasting deficit in visual
   guidance of movement of the
   arms and fingers. Lesions of the
   ventral group do not.
