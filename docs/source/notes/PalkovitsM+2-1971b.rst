   Cell type   | Species   | Value         | Reference
   grannule    | cat       | 2.2 x 10^9    | PalkovitsM+2-1971b
   golgi       | cat       | 417,000       | PalkovitsM+2-1971b


Figure is given on page 29 (summary section).  Also states that the
The granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio was 1700-1800 : 1.

Paper also states that the ratio of Golgi cells to Purkinje cells is
1 : 3.  This means, that if there are 1.25 x 10^6 Purkinje cells,
then there are about 416,666 Golgi cells (rounded, about 417,000).
