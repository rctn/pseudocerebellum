   Cell type   | Species   | Value         | Reference
   grannule    | cat       | 2.2 x 10^9    | PalkovitsM+2-1971b
   golgi       | cat       | 417,000       | PalkovitsM+2-1971b


Figure is given on page 29 (summary section).  Also states that the
The granule cell : Purkinje cell ratio was 1700-1800 : 1.

Paper also states that the ratio of Golgi cells to Purkinje cells is
1 : 3.  This means, that if there are 1.25 x 10^6 Purkinje cells,
then there are about 416,666 Golgi cells (rounded, about 417,000).


p. 30:

This density of the Golgi cells -- assuming non-overlap
between dendrites and axons -- would require a compartmentation of the space
available to the Golgi cells in an idealized model into hexagonal prisms of around
100 #m diameter. The prisms would cut vertically through all 3 layers of the cortex,
and the volume of the part corresponding to the granular layer would be approximately
0.002 cu.mm (calculated for the living cat), containing about 200 glomeruli.


If 200 glomeruli are contacted by each Golgi cell, then the number of granule cells
potentiall connected by each Golgi cell would be 200 * 112 = 2.24 x 10^4.
This is different than the figure of 5.2x10^3 in :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` Fig 2.
If the average was 28 granule cells per glomeruli, the figure would be
200 * 28 = 5.6x10^3 which is closer to the figure in :cite:`LoebnerEE-1989` Fig 2.
