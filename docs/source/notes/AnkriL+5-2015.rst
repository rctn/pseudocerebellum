This paper shows that cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons inhibit some Golgi cells.

Abstract:

   The cerebellum, a crucial center for motor coordination, is composed of a cortex and
   several nuclei. The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by
   the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing
   that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the
   cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar
   Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the
   inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may
   contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition
   onto granule cells.

   Currently, the cerebellar cortex and the CN are known to interact through two circuits. The best
   known is the nucleo-olivary (NO) circuit (Apps and Garwicz, 2005; Apps and Hawkes, 2009;
   Chaumont et al., 2013), where the small GABAergic CN cells, subject to PN inhibition (Najac and
   Raman, 2015), project to the contralateral IO (Fredette and Mugnaini, 1991). This pathway regulates
   olivary activity (Chen et al., 2010; Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012; Chaumont et al., 2013; Lefler et al.,
   2014) and thereby complex spike activity in the PNs and cerebellar cortical plasticity (Hansel and
   Linden, 2000; Coesmans et al., 2004; Bengtsson and Hesslow, 2006; Medina and Lisberger,
   2008).
   
   A less-known nucleo-cortical circuit is formed by the glutamatergic neurons of the CN which, in
   addition to projecting to various premotor and associative regions of the brain (Tsukahara and
   Bando, 1970; Asanuma et al., 1980; Angaut et al., 1985; Sultan et al., 2012; Ruigrok and Teune,
   2014), send axonal collaterals to the cerebellar granule cell layer (GrCL; Houck and Person, 2015).
   These collateral fibers form MF-like terminals contacting granule cell (GrC) and Golgi cell dendrites
   (see also Tolbert et al., 1976, 1977, 1978; Ha´mori et al., 1980; Payne, 1983). The functional
   significance of this excitatory nucleo-cortical (eNC) pathway, loosely following the modular
   arrangement of the cerebellum (Dietrichs and Walberg, 1979; Gould, 1979; Haines and Pearson,
   1979; Tolbert and Bantli, 1979; Buisseret-Delmas, 1988; Provini et al., 1998; Ruigrok, 2010 ;
   reviewed by Houck and Person, 2013), is likely related to efference copying of motor commands to
   the cerebellar cortex (Sommer and Wurtz, 2008; Houck and Person, 2015).
   
   In addition to the pathways linking the CN with the cerebellar cortex mentioned above, evidence
   has occasionally emerged for an inhibitory nucleo-cortical (iNC) pathway. GABAergic neurons have
   been shown to be labeled in the CN by retrograde tracing from the cerebellar cortex (Batini et al.,
   1989), and nucleo-cortical terminals with non-glutamatergic ultrastructural features have been found
   to contact putative Golgi cell dendrites (Tolbert et al., 1980). More recently, it was demonstrated
   that GlyT2-expressing CN neurons extend axons toward the cerebellar cortex (Uusisaari and
   Kno¨pfel, 2010), suggesting that the iNC pathway might be identifiable by its glycinergic phenotype.
   While the iNC projection is likely to have significant impact on cerebellar computation, its
   postsynaptic targets and its functional organization remain unknown.
