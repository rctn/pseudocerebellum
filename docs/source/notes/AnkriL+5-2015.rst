This paper shows that cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons inhibit some Golgi cells.

Abstract:

   The cerebellum, a crucial center for motor coordination, is composed of a cortex and
   several nuclei. The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by
   the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing
   that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the
   cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar
   Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the
   inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may
   contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition
   onto granule cells.
